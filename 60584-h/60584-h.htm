  <h2 class='c010'>PREFACE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Having, as I thought, completed this book—bar
the Preface, which is, of course, always the
last chapter—I sent it in manuscript to an old
friend of mine for his opinion.</p>

<p class='c012'>He let me have it.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Your brochure,” he wrote, “is remarkable
more perhaps for what it omits than for what it
contains. For example, there is no mention
whatever made of the <em>vomero-nasal organ, or organ
of Jacobson</em>.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Then, after drastically sweeping away the much
that seems to him redundant in the body of the
work, he closes his general criticism (which I
omit) with “I should like to have heard your
views on the vomero-nasal organ. Parker devotes
a whole chapter to it.”</p>

<p class='c012'>A carpenter, according to the adage, is known
by his chips. And it was by the simple removal
of some superfluous marble, as everyone knows,
that the Venus of Milo was revealed to the world—which
is only another way of saying the same
thing.</p>

<p class='c012'>But what sort of a carpenter is he who leaves
<span class='pageno' id='Page_vi'>vi</span>among his chips the mouldings of his door?
And what should we say of the sculptor, even in
these days, who would treat as a superfluity his
lady’s chin?</p>

<p class='c012'>No mention of the vomero-nasal or Jacobson’s
organ! A serious, nay! a damning, defect.</p>

<p class='c012'>So here am I trying to atone for the sin of
omission by giving the neglected item place of
honour in my Preface. “The stone which the
builders rejected....”</p>

<p class='c012'>But my motive for erecting it here, in the gateway
to my little pagoda of the perfumes, is not
quite so simple as I am pretending. The fact is
that in my capacity as creator I predetermined, I
actually foredained, the omission from my text of
the structure to which “Parker devotes a whole
chapter.”</p>

<p class='c012'>I am sorry in some ways. But as the Aberdeen
minister so consolingly said: “There are many
things the Creator does in His offeecial capacity
that He would scorn to do as a private indiveedual.”</p>

<p class='c012'>You see, I had a feeling about it. One of those
feelings artists are subject to. (But a scientific
writer an artist?—Certainly! Why not?)</p>

<p class='c012'>I felt, to be quite frank, that if I were to interpolate
a description and a discussion of this
<em>minutia</em> my book would&nbsp;... would.... Quite
so. The artist will understand.</p>

<p class='c012'>I came, in short, to look upon this “organ,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_vii'>vii</span>this nose within a nose, as a touchstone, so to
speak. The thing became a Symbol.</p>

<p class='c012'>But here we plunge head over heels into the
Subjective, on the other side of which stream lie
the misty shades of the Occult. For that is what
happens to you when you begin talking about
Symbols.</p>

<p class='c012'>However, we shall not be crossing to the other
side on this occasion, my symbolism being after
all but a humdrum affair.—Merely this, that to
me this organ of Jacobson is the symbol of the
Exhaustive—of the minute, punctilious, unwearying,
laboured comprehensiveness, Teutonic in its
over and under and through, that characterises
the genuine, the reliable, scientific treatise and
renders it so desperately full of interest—to
examinees.</p>

<p class='c012'>Imagine, if you can, the indignation of kindly
Sir Walter were the news ever to reach him in
Valhalla that urchins now at school are not only
forced to study his light-hearted romances as
holiday tasks, but are actually examined upon
them!</p>

<p class='c012'>So, comparing small things with great, let me
say: “<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Absit omen</span></i>.”</p>

<p class='c011'>My faith in the spoken charm of that phrase is,
however, none too robust. Heaven helps the
man who helps himself. And so, by way of reinforcing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_viii'>viii</span>the Powers in their efforts to divert professorial
attention from this essay of mine, I am
leaving it, by a careful act of carelessness, incomplete.</p>

<p class='c012'>Here, then, you have the real reason for my
exclusion of the organ of Jacobson (and the like).
It is merely a dodge to prevent the book ever
becoming a task in any way, for any one, at any
time.</p>

<p class='c012'>He who runs may read herein, then, without
slackening pace—or he may refrain from reading,
just as he pleases, seeing that he can never be
under the compulsion of remembering a single
word I have written.</p>

<p class='c012'>This, if I may say so, is, in my opinion, the only
kind of book worth reading. At all events, it is
the only kind I ever enjoy reading, and I say
if a book is not enjoyable it is already placed upon
the only Index Expurgatorius that is worth
a&nbsp;... an anathema.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_1'>1</span>
  <h2 class='c010'>CHAPTER 1<br /> <span class='large'>OLFACTION AND PUBLIC HEALTH</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c011'>I sing of smells, of scents, perfumes, odours,
whiffs and niffs; of aromas, bouquets and
fragrances; and also, though temperately and
restrainedly I promise you, of effluvia, reeks,
fœtors, stenches, and stinks.</p>

<p class='c011'>A few years ago I stood before the public
singing another song. By no means a service of
praise it was, but something of the order of a
denunciatory psalm, wherein I invoked the wrath
of the high gods upon such miscreants as make life
hideous with din.</p>

<p class='c012'>You must not think that imprecations cannot be
sung. All emotional utterance is song, said
Carlyle; only he said it not quite so briefly. And,
leaving on one side the vituperations of his enemies
by King David (if he it was who wrote the Psalms)
which we still chant upon certain days of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>Christian year, it may be remembered that in
bygone times when the medical practitioner was a
wizard (or a witch) and uttered his (or her) spell
to stay the arrows of Apollo, it not infrequently
contained a denunciation of some brother (or
sister) practitioner of the art (how times are
changed!), and it was known, in Rome at all events,
as a <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">carmen</span></i>, a song. Hence, say the etymologists,
the English word “charm,” which still, of course,
characterises the modern witch, if not the modern
wizard—neither of whom, we may add, is nowadays
a medical practitioner.</p>

<p class='c012'>Besides, denunciations are, of course, grunted
and growled with more or less of a semblance of
singing in modern opera. To substantiate my
words I need only mention that interminable
scene—or is it an act?—of gloom and evil plottings
by Telramund and Ortrud in <cite>Lohengrin</cite>.</p>

<p class='c012'>But if I am again singing, this time, I trust, my
voice will sound in the ears of my hearers less
shrill, less strident, less of a shriek. For, in sooth,
the present theme is one upon which we are justly
entitled, in so far as England and Scotland at all
events are concerned, to raise what would be a
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Nunc Dimittis</span></i> of praise and thanksgiving, were it
not that the price of cleanly air like that of liberty
is eternal vigilance, seeing that our nostrils are no
longer offended by the stenches our forefathers
had to put up with. That they endured such
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>offences philosophically, cheerfully even, laughing
at the unpleasantness as men do at a bad smell, is
true. Nevertheless most people in those days
probably felt as much objection to a vile odour as
Queen Elizabeth, for example, did, the sharpness
of whose nose, her biographers tell us, was only
equalled by the sharpness of her tongue.</p>

<p class='c011'>Irishmen who do me the honour of tasting this
light omelette of scientific literature will have
noticed, I am sure, that I have not included the
sister isle in my olfactory paradise. And indeed, I
hesitated long before passing it over, because I am
a man of peace—at any price where the Land of
Ire is concerned. But alas! I am by nature
truthful and only by art mendacious. And there
sticks horrible to my memory the fumous and
steamy stench of parboiled cabbage that filled the
restaurant-car of the train for Belfast—yes!
Belfast, not Dublin—one evening as I landed at
Kingstown. The sea had been—well! it was
the Irish Sea, and I stepped on to the train straight
from the mail-boat, so that&nbsp;... in a word, I
remember that luscious but washy odour too
vividly to bestow upon Ireland the white flower
of a stenchless life.</p>

<p class='c012'>In these remarks I have been careful to observe
that the train was not the Dublin train, but if any
one feels moved to defend the capital city, let him
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>first of all take a stroll down by the Liffey as it
flows fermenting and bubbling under its bridges,
and then&nbsp;... if he can....</p>

<p class='c012'>Let me, however, in justice to that grief-stricken
country, spray a little perfume over my too
pungent observations. I can also recall after many
years a warm and balmy evening in the town of
Killarney, the peaceful close to a day of torrential
rain. The setting sun, glowing love through its
tears, was reddening the sky and the dark green
hills around, those hills of Ireland where surely,
if anywhere on this earth, heaven is foreshadowed.
And linked in memory with that evening’s glory
there comes, like the gentle strain of a long-forgotten
song, the rich, pungent smell of turf-smoke
eddying blue from low chimneys into the
soft air of the twilight. Ireland! Ireland!
What an atmosphere of love and grief that name
calls up! Surely the surf that beats upon the
strands of Innisfail far away is more salt, more
bitter, and perhaps for that very reason more
sweet, than the waters of any of the other beaches
that ocean bathes!</p>

<p class='c012'>Thence also comes a memory of heliotrope. It
grew by a cottage just beyond a grey granite
fishing-harbour in Dublin Bay, and brings also,
with its faint, ineffable fragrance, the same
inseparable blending of emotions that clings, itself
a never-dying odour, to the memory of holidays
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>in Ireland. There is a phrase in a song, simple,
sentimental, even silly if you like, that prays for
“the peace of mind dearer than all.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“But what,” I remember asking the mother of
our party—“what is meant by ‘peace of mind’?”
Her wistful smile seemed to me to be a very
inadequate reply to my question—which, by the
way, I am still asking.</p>

<p class='c011'>It is an historical fact that the movement which
rendered England the pioneer country in the
matter of Public Health received its first impulse
from, and even now owes its continued existence
to, the simple accident that the English public
has grown intolerant of over-obtrusive odours.
Stenches have attained to the dignity of a legal
topic of interest, and are now by Act of Parliament
become “nuisances” in law as well as in nature,
with the result that they have been, for the most
part, banished from the face of the land and the
noses of its inhabitants.</p>

<p class='c012'>The reason assigned by the man in the street
for this reform was, and indeed still is, that
stenches breed epidemic diseases. In a noisome
smell people imagine a deadly pestilence, probably
because patients affected with such epidemic
diseases as smallpox, typhus, and diphtheria, give
off nauseating odours. Now, bad smells from
drains and cesspools do not of themselves induce
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>epidemic disease. Nevertheless, there is this
much of truth in the superstition, that where you
have bad smells you have also surface accumulations
of filth, and these, soaking through soil and
subsoil, contaminate surface wells, until it only
requires the advent of a typhoid or other “carrier”
to set a widespread epidemic a-going. Further, as
recent investigators have shown us, the loathsome
and deadly typhus fever, known for years to be a
“filth-disease,” is carried by lice, which pests
breed and flourish where bodily cleanliness is
neglected and personal odours are strong.</p>

<p class='c012'>So that in this, as in most superstitions, there is
a substratum of truth.</p>

<p class='c012'>But the point is, that the objection to bad smells
preceded all those scientific discoveries and had,
in the beginning, but a slender support from
rationalism. Our forebears builded better than
they knew. Their objection was in reality
intuitive. It may be true that all nations occupying
a corresponding level of civilisation will
manifest the same instinctive abhorrences, but it
has been left to the practical genius of the English
race to give effect to the natural repugnance and
to translate its urgings into practice.</p>

<p class='c012'>The interesting question now arises: How and
when did this intuition or instinct, this blind
feeling, arise, and what transformed it from a mere
individual objection, voiced here and there, to a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>mass-movement leading to a general popular
reformation?</p>

<p class='c012'>The first explanation that is likely to occur to
us is, that it was due to the refinement of feeling
that accompanies high civilisation operating in a
community quick to respond and to react when a
public benefit is anticipated. One of the results
of culture is an increase in the delicacy of the
senses. When men and women strive after refinement,
they achieve it, becoming refined, in spite
of what pessimists and so-called realists preach,
not only in their outward behaviour, but also in
their innermost thoughts and feelings, and this
internal refinement implies among other things a
quickening of the sense of disgust. There is
naturally a close and intimate connection between
the sense of smell and the nerve-centres which,
when stimulated, evoke the feeling of nausea in
the mind—and the bodily acts that follow it. We
are here dealing, in fact, with a primitive protective
impulse to ensure that evil-smelling things shall
not be swallowed, and the means adopted by
Nature to prevent that ingestion, or, if it has
accidentally occurred, to reverse it, are prompt.
And successful. There is no compromise with
the evil thing.</p>

<p class='c012'>Like all other nerve-reactions, this particular
reflex can be educated: either up or down. It
can be blunted and degraded, or it can be rendered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>more acute, more prompt to react. Now, one of
the effects of civilised life, of town life, is to
abbreviate the period of all reflex action. And if
this applies to knee-jerks and to seeing jokes, it is
even more noticeable in the particular reflex we
are here considering.</p>

<p class='c012'>A citizen of Cologne in Coleridge’s days, for
example, must have been anosmic to most of
the seven-and-twenty stenches that offended the
Englishman, and in my own time I have counted
as many as ten objectionable public perfumes,
yea! even in Lucerne, the “Lovely Lucerne” of
the railway posters. Several of these, perhaps,
did not amount to more than a mere whiff, just
the suspicion of a something unpleasant, no more
(but no less) disturbing than, say, one note a semitone
flat in a major chord; two or three of them,
however, to the sensitive, thin-winged organ of an
English school-ma’am, would have attained to the
rank of a “smell,” a word on her lips as emphatic
as an oath on yours or mine; four of them, at
the least, were plain stenches, and so beyond
<em>her</em> vocabulary altogether; and one was—well!
beyond even mine, but only too eloquent itself of
something ugly and bloated, some mess becoming
aerial just round the corner. I did not turn that
corner.</p>

<p class='c012'>Now, the people of Lucerne could never have
smelled them, or at all events they could never
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>have appreciated those perfumes as I did, or the
town would have been evacuated. Their olfactory
sense compared with mine must have been a
stupid thing, dense to begin with, and cudgelled
by use and wont into blank insensibility. Because,
it is obvious, delicacy in this, as in all the senses,
can only be acquired by avoiding habitual overstimulation.
And that avoidance is only possible
in a country where odours are fine, etherealised,
rare.</p>

<p class='c011'>Even in France, France the enlightened, the
sensitive, the refined, primitive odours pervade
the country, as our Army knows very well. Not
only is the farm dunghill given place of honour in
the farm courtyard, close to doors and windows,
but even in the mansions of the wealthy the cesspool
still remains—not outside, but inside, the
house, the water-carriage system, even the pail-system
(if that can be called a system), being
unknown. So that our Army authorities had to
send round a peculiar petrol-engine, known to the
Tommies as “Stinking Willie,” to empty those
pools of corruption. Some of the monasteries
used by us as hospitals were, at the beginning of
the war, even worse.</p>

<p class='c012'>From this we may surmise that the olfactory
sense of our neighbours is not yet so sensitive as
is ours.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>But in this matter Western Europe, at its
worst—say, in one of the corridor-trains to Marseilles—is
a mountain-top to a pigstye compared
with the old and gorgeous East. “The East,”
ejaculated an old Scotsman once—“the East is
just a smell! It begins at Port Said and disna stop
till ye come to San Francisco,&nbsp;... if there!” he
added after a pause. From his sweeping condemnation
we must, however, exempt Japan.</p>

<p class='c012'>Who can ever forget the bazaar smells of India,
the mingled must and fust with its background of
garlic and strange vices, or the still more mysterious
atmospheres of China with their deep suggestion
of musk?</p>

<p class='c012'>Naturally the air of a cold country is clearer of
obnoxious vapours than that of tropical and subtropical
climes, but in spite of that, the first whiff
of a Tibetan monastery, like that of an Eskimo hut,
grips the throat, they say, like the air over a brewing
vat.</p>

<p class='c012'>So that, after making every allowance for the
favour of Nature, we are still entitled to claim that
the relative purity of England, and of English
cities, towns and even villages, is an artificial
achievement.</p>

<p class='c012'>I may therefore, with justice, raise a song of
praise to our fathers who have had our country
thus swept and garnished, swept of noxious
vapours and emanations, and garnished with the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>perfume of pure and fresh air, to the delight and
invigoration of our souls.</p>

<p class='c012'>And yet the change has only recently been
brought about. Up to the beginning of the nineteenth
century the city of London</p>

<blockquote>
<p class='c016'>“was certainly as foul as could be. The streets were
unpaved or paved only with rough cobble stones. There
were no side walks. The houses projected over the roadway,
and were unprovided with rain-water gutters, and during a
shower rain fell from the roofs into the middle of the street.
These streets were filthy from constant contributions of
slops and ordure from animals and human beings. There
were no underground drains, and the soil of the town was
soaked with the filth of centuries. This sodden condition of
the soil must have affected the wells to a greater or less
extent.” (“London, Sanitary and Medical,” by G. V.
Poore. 1889.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p class='c012'>Moreover, the nineteenth century was well on
its way before the last of the private cesspools
disappeared from the dwelling-houses of London.</p>

<p class='c012'>Edinburgh during the Middle Ages was, we are
told, fresher and cleaner upon its wind-swept
ridge than London, but with the erection of lofty
houses in the High Street and Haymarket of the
northern capital its atmosphere became much
worse than that of London. The reason for this
was that while the London houses remained low,
and the population therefore, for a city, widely
distributed, in those of Edinburgh, on the other
hand, a large community of all classes of society
was concentrated, from the noble lord and lady
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>to the beggarly caddie and quean. And the
whole stew was quite innocent of what we call
drainage. Quite. Yet the waste-products of life,
the lees and offscourings of humanity, all that
housemaids call “slops,” had to be got rid of.
Very simple problem this to our worthy Edinburgh
forefathers. After dark the windows up in these
“lands” were thrust open, and with a shrill cry
of “Gardy-loo” (<em>Gardez l’eau</em>) the cascade of
swipes and worse fell into the street below with a
splash and an od—. “Ha! ha!” laughed Dr.
Johnson to little Boswell; “I can smell you there
in the dark!”</p>

<p class='c012'>The hygienic reformation of Britain, although
adumbrated by sundry laws made at intervals from
the fifteenth century onwards, was not seriously
taken in hand until as late as the sixties of last
century, and Disraeli’s famous Act defining a bad
smell as a “nuisance” became law in 1875.</p>

<p class='c011'>But although we may justly congratulate ourselves
upon the hygienic achievements of England,
one result of which has been the minimising of
unpleasant odours, nevertheless, as a wider consideration
of the facts will show us, the task of
cleansing the air of England is not yet entirely
completed. It is doubtless true that what we may
term domestic stenches have for the most part been
dispelled, but as regards public fœtors there are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>still, I regret to say, a few that abide with us,
seemingly as nasty as ever they were.</p>

<p class='c012'>One deplorable instance you will encounter at
the Paddington terminus of the Great Western
Railway no less, at a certain platform of which
station, lying in wait for our fresh country cousins
on their arrival in London, there lurks a livid concoction
of ancient milk, horse-manure, live stock,
dead stock, and, in the month of July, fermenting
strawberries, as aggressive and unashamed as the
worst Lucerne has to offer. I commend it to the
attention of the Medical Officer of Health for
Paddington.</p>

<p class='c012'>Nay more! This West London efflorescence
does not lie blooming alone. It is by no means the
last rose of summer. On the east side of the great
city, another, a rival upas-tree, spreads its nauseating
blight. This is a mess that, oozing from a
soap factory near Stratford-atte-Bow, envelops
in its oleaginous cloud several hundred yards of
the main line of the Great Eastern Railway. And
the world we live in is so arranged that the trains,
particularly in summer, are held up by signal for
several minutes in this neighbourhood, so that, as
the greasy slabs of decomposing fats slump in at
the open carriage windows, an early opportunity
is afforded to our Continental visitors of becoming
acquainted with the purifying properties of English
soap.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>I am blushing now for what I have been saying
about Ireland, Cologne, Lucerne, France, and even
the East.</p>

<p class='c012'>This last instance, however, opens up a large
subject, that, namely, of malodorous industries.
Of these there is a great number, too great indeed
for me to do more than make a passing allusion
to them. The proximity of evil-smelling works
and factories to human habitations is, as a matter of
fact, prohibited by the Public Health Acts, but it
is naturally impossible to remove them entirely
from the knowledge of mankind inasmuch as the
workers frequently carry the atmosphere about
with them. Fortunately for them, but unfortunately
for us, by reason of the rapid exhaustion
of the olfactory sense (which we are about to deal
with in the following section), they are, for the
most part, not incommoded by the objectionable
airs they work in.</p>

<p class='c012'>Perhaps the worst of all are the bone-manure
factories, malodorous mills which are almost
invariably situated at a distance of several miles
from any dwelling-house, as it would be impossible
for any one but the workers themselves to live in
their neighbourhood. These unfortunate people,
many of whom are women, carry, as I have already
remarked, the stench about with them on their
clothing and persons, and I have observed that,
being themselves insensitive to the odour, they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>cannot rid themselves of it even on Sundays and
holidays.</p>

<p class='c012'>In this class also we must place tanneries, glueworks,
and size factories, a visit to which is a severe
trial for any one unaccustomed to them. Dyeworks,
likewise, by reason of the organic sulphur
compounds they disseminate through the spongy
air, are unpleasant neighbours. In cotton mills,
also, the sizing-rooms are objectionable, and here,
curiously enough, the operatives do not seem to
become accustomed to the smell, as it is insinuatingly
rather than bluntly offensive, and grows
worse with use. So much so, indeed, that but few
of the girls, I am told, are able to remain in that
particular occupation for more than a few weeks
at a time.</p>

<p class='c011'>At this stage, albeit early in our disquisition, we
may appropriately turn to consider the curious
fact that of all our senses that of smell is perhaps
the most easily exhausted. The olfactory organ,
under the continued stimulation of one particular
odour, quite quickly becomes insensitive to it.
Perhaps this is the reason, or one of the reasons,
why reform was so long delayed.</p>

<p class='c012'>There are, however, in this respect great
differences between odours. With some the smell
is lost in a few seconds, while with others we continue
to be aware of it for a much longer time.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>Curiously enough, odours seem, in this matter, to
follow the general law of the feelings in that the
pleasant are lost sooner than the unpleasant. It is
the first breath of the rose that makes the fullest
appeal, when the whole being becomes for a
moment suffused with the loveliest of all perfumes.
But only for a moment. All too soon the door of
heaven closes and the richness thins away into the
common airs of this our lower world.</p>

<p class='c012'>On the other hand, the aversion we all feel from
substances like iodoform, or, what is worse, scatol,
owes not the least part of its strength to the fact
that both of those vile smells are very persistent.
As was once said to a surgeon applying iodoform
to a wound in a patient’s nose: “This patient will
certainly visit you again, sir, but—it will not be to
consult you!”</p>

<p class='c012'>To this more or less rapid exhaustion of the
sense is due the merciful dispensation that no one
is aware of his own particular aura. We are only
cognisant of odours that are strange to us. The
Chinese and Japanese find the neighbourhood of
Europeans highly objectionable, and we return
the compliment. It is the stranger to the Island
who remarks the “very ancient and fish-like
smell.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Fatigue and then exhaustion of a sense-organ,
rendering it finally irresponsive to a particular
stimulus, is, of course, familiar to us also in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>case of vision, as the soap advertisement of our
boyhood with its complementary colours taught
us. Taste manifests the same phenomenon, for
which reason (so he says) the cheese-taster in
Scotland swallows a little whisky after each of the
different samples he tries. But, curiously enough,
the healthy ear is not thus dulled save by a very
loud, persistent noise, and then there is the risk of
permanent damage to the hearing organ. Some
forms of tactile sensation, also, would seem to
remain ever sensitive, for, although it may be
possible to become so inured to pain as to ignore it,
yet that is probably a mental act, and it is said,
moreover, that men have been tortured to death
by the tickling of the soles of their feet.</p>

<p class='c012'>But, as we have already seen, of all the senses
none so quickly becomes inert under stimulation
as olfaction. Why it would be hard to say, unless,
like the exhaustion of colour-vision, it is due to the
using up of some chemical reagent in the sense-organ.
At all events, if you wish to appreciate the
full intensity of a smell, you should arrange to
come upon it from the open air.</p>

<p class='c012'>I wonder if this, or something like it, is the
reason why England was the first country in the
world to wage war against its stenches. For the
English are of all races the most addicted to fresh
air. Consequently, they are the most likely to
keep habitually their olfactory sense unspoiled and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>virgin. This, I admit, is only pushing the matter
a step further back, and we are still left with the
question: Why is it that the English are so fond
of the open? Largely, I imagine, because their
climate is so damp that an indoor atmosphere is
always a little oppressive to them.</p>

<p class='c012'>Whatever may be the reason, however, there is
no doubt that the keen, clean chill of an English
April day, especially when the wind is in the east
(<em>pace</em> Mr. Jarndyce), brings to us an exaltation of
spirit that surpasses the exhilaration of wine, and
at the same time renders us impatient with mustiness
and fustiness, intolerant of domestic stuffiness,
and frankly disgusted with the pungent, prickly
vapours of intimate humanity in the mass. The
wind on the hilltop is our aspiration, our ideal.
Hence, maybe, the Public Health Acts, and also
the national tub.</p>

<p class='c012'>The use of the domestic bath is, we must not
forget, a social revolution of our own day and
generation. Our grandfathers ventured upon a
bath only when it seemed to be called for—by
others. Our grandmothers, with their clean,
white cotton or linen undergarments, had, or
thought they had, even less need for it. Besides,
in their prim and bashful eyes the necessary
denudation antecedent to total immersion would
have amounted, even when they were alone, to
something like gross indecency. Before their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>time, again, in the eighteenth century, matters
were even worse, for the society ladies of that
day painted their faces <em>instead</em> of washing them,
and mitigated the effects of seldom-changed
underclothing by copiously drenching themselves
with musk and other reliable perfumes. (I am
told, however, that even to-day fashionable ladies
refrain from washing their faces!)</p>

<p class='c012'>The domestic bathroom is the direct offspring
of the gravitation water-supply and the modern
system of drainage. Buy an old house, and you
will have to convert one of the bedrooms into
your bathroom, and, to this day, you must carry
your bath with you if you go to reside in certain
of the Oxford colleges.</p>

<p class='c011'>I can myself remember in my younger days in
Scotland an old doctor having his first bath in the
palatial surroundings of a modern bathroom. Not
in his own house, needless to say! After a patient
and particular inspection of all the glittering taps
of “shower,” “spray,” “plunge,” and what not,
he commended his spirit to the Higher Powers—or
rather, I fear, according to his wont, for he was
not of the Holy Willie persuasion, to the keeping
of those of the Nether Regions. Then he proceeded
gingerly to insert into the steaming water
first of all his toes, then his feet, next his ankles,
and so bit by bit, until, greatly daring, he had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>committed his entire body to the deep—to emerge
as soon as possible! He was no coward, let me
tell you, in the ordinary run of life. But this was
his first bath in the altogether since his primal
post-natal plunge. His first bath! And his last!
It nearly killed him, he said; never in all his life
had he felt so bad, and not for a thousand pounds
would he repeat the experiment!</p>

<p class='c011'>One more tale. Cockney this time. A gentleman
of my acquaintance was one day discussing
with an old-fashioned baker the modern making
of bread by machinery. Both agreed that the
older method made the better bread. The new
was not so good. “It seems,” said my friend,
“as if nowadays bread lacks something, but what
that something is I cannot tell.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“You are puffickly right, sir,” returned the
baker. “It does lack something, and wot that
something is I can tell you—it lacks the aromer
of the ’uman ’and!”</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>
  <h2 class='c010'>CHAPTER II<br /> <span class='large'>THE SENSE OF OLFACTION IN LOWER ANIMALS</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Olfaction is generally felt to be the lowest,
the most animal, of the senses, so much so that
in polite society it is scarcely good manners to
mention smells, and I am well aware of the risks
I run in writing a book on the subject. And yet
this feeling is by no means false modesty, because
it is, first and foremost, to the animal in us that
smell makes its appeal. None of the other senses
brings so frankly to notice our kinship with the
brute.</p>

<p class='c012'>Olfaction is, indeed, one of the primitive senses
of animal life. And in man, as it happens, while
vision has constructed for itself a highly complicated
camera-like end-organ, and hearing has
produced an apparatus even more elaborate, the
olfactory organ, on the other hand, remains
primitive, its essential structure having undergone
no apparent evolutionary change from the simplest
and earliest type.</p>

<p class='c012'>This, perhaps, is scarcely the proper way of
expressing the situation. Evolutionary change
has, as a matter of fact, occurred, but it reaches
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>its highest development not in man, but in
terrestrial mammals otherwise inferior to him—in
the dog, for example.</p>

<p class='c012'>For once, man does not occupy the apex of the
evolutionary pyramid.</p>

<p class='c012'>Olfactory development, high or low, is linked
up with the natural habits of the different species.
Thus, mammals which go about on all fours,
whose visual outlook is restricted and whose
muzzle is near the ground, are the most highly
gifted; those, again, like the seals, porpoises,
whales, and walruses, which have reverted from
a terrestrial to an aqueous environment, where
smell is of less value to them, show poorly
developed olfactory organs; and finally, the apes
and man, living habitually above the ground, the
former in trees, the latter on his hind legs, and
relying chiefly upon vision, also show a decline
from the high point reached by four-footed
mammalians.</p>

<p class='c012'>The animals of this kingdom are thus divided
into macrosmatic and microsmatic groups. To
the latter man belongs, but we must add that his
olfactory sense has not yet degenerated so completely
as that of certain other species (porpoises,
etc.).</p>

<p class='c012'>It is, of course, common knowledge that in
most of the animals we are closely acquainted with
the sense of smell is infinitely more delicate and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>acute than ours, so much so, indeed, that the
imagination can on occasion scarcely conceive
theirs to be of the same nature. As a matter of
fact, many authorities incline to the belief that
not only mammalians and other vertebrates, but
also insects, must be guided to their food and
to their love-mates by some kind of perception,
by some mysterious sense, of which we are totally
devoid.</p>

<p class='c012'>As this is a division of our subject of the
highest interest, and one to which we shall have
occasion to recur at intervals throughout this
treatise, we shall discuss the matter as fully as
the space at our disposal will permit.</p>

<p class='c011'>The unit of the olfactory sense-organ is the
olfactory cell. This, which does not vary in
structure from one end of the animal kingdom to
the other, is microscopically seen to consist of an
elongated body like a tiny rod, bearing on its
free end a small enlargement or prominence, on
the surface of which is a cluster of extremely fine
protoplasmic filaments, the olfactory hairs. These
hairs project into and are immersed in a thin
layer of mucus, at all events in air-breathing
animals, an environment which is necessary for
their functional activity, because, if the nose
becomes desiccated, as it does in some diseases,
the sense of smell is lost (anosmia). The hairs
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>are, without doubt, the true receptive elements of
the olfactory cells. It is these which come into
contact with and are stimulated by odours—whatever
the nature of Odour may be.</p>

<p class='c012'>The deep (proximal) end of the rod-like
olfactory cell tapers into a nerve-fibre, which
passes by way of the olfactory nerve to a special
lobe of the brain—the olfactory lobe—in the
vertebrates, or to a nerve-ganglion in the invertebrates.</p>

<p class='c012'>Olfactory cells in man are only found in the
upper—the olfactory—region of the nose, spread
over a surface of about one square inch, the
olfactory area—part lying on the outer (lateral)
wall of each nasal passage and part on the septum,
or partition between the nasal passages. In
macrosmatic animals the olfactory area is relatively
greater than in man, but there is apparently
no other difference between them.</p>

<p class='c012'>Olfactory cells are held in place by ordinary
epithelial cells—the sustentacular cells—which
contain pigment. Olfactory cells are found in
animals as low in the scale as the sea-anemone.
They occur in the integument of the animal, and
their structure is the same as in man, the only
difference evolution has brought about being
that in the higher animals they are protected by
lodgment in a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cul-de-sac</span></i>. Their function in the
sea-anemone is probably limited to the sensing of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>food, but we do not yet know much about this
particular organism.</p>

<p class='c011'>It is otherwise with the olfaction of insects.
Here the work of painstaking observers like
Lubbock, Fabre, and Forel, has supplied us with
a mass of information of the utmost interest,
which we shall now proceed to discuss in some
detail, commencing with the work of that remarkable
French naturalist, Fabre, whose interest in
the subject was aroused by an accident—the
accident of which the genius of observation knows
so well how to take advantage.</p>

<p class='c011'>Having by chance a living female Great Peacock
moth captive in his house, Fabre was surprised
one night by the advent of some forty others of
the same species—males in search of a mate. At
once the question arose in his mind: How was it
that they had been attracted?</p>

<p class='c012'>Sight could not have guided them, because,
apart from the comparative rarity of this moth in
that particular district, the night of their arrival
was dark and stormy, his house was screened by
trees and shrubs, and the female was ensconced
under a gauze cover. He observed, besides, that
the males did not make straight for their objective,
as is characteristic of movement when directed
by sight. They blundered and went astray, some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>of them wandering into rooms other than that in
which the female was lying. They behaved, that
is to say, as we ourselves do when we are trying
to locate the source of a sound or a smell. But
sound was ruled out by the fact that they must
have been summoned from distances of a mile or
a mile and a half.</p>

<p class='c012'>Olfaction remains, and with this in his mind
Fabre undertook several experiments, some of
which, as it happens, support, while others oppose,
the theory of an olfactory cause.</p>

<p class='c012'>When the female was sequestered under the
gauze cover, and in drawers or in boxes with
loosely-fitting lids, the males always succeeded in
discovering her. But when she was placed under
a glass cover, or in a sealed receptacle, no male at
all appeared. Further, Fabre found that cotton-wool
stuffed into the openings and cracks of her
receptacle was also sufficient to prevent the
summons reaching the males. This last observation
should be borne in mind in view of further
discussion later on regarding the nature of the lure.</p>

<p class='c012'>Similar observations and experiments were
made on the Lesser Peacock, with very much the
same kind of result. But in dealing with this
moth Fabre made an observation which, if it
was accurate, tells against the theory of olfaction,
or at least against such olfaction as we ourselves
experience. At the time when he was carrying
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>out his experiments the mistral was blowing hard
from the north, and as nevertheless males arrived,
they must all have come with the wind; no moth
ever hatched could beat up against the mistral.
But then, if the guide is an odour, the wind,
blowing it to the south, would have prevented it
ever reaching the males! Here, then, we have a
circumstance which leaves us groping for an
explanation.</p>

<p class='c012'>In watching the behaviour of the third moth
on his list, the Banded Monk, on the other
hand, Fabre discerned a circumstance very strongly
suggestive of the operation of an odorous lure.
He found that, if the female was left for a time in
contact with some absorbent material and was
afterwards shifted, the males were attracted, not
to her new situation, but to the place where she
had originally been lying. Subsequent experiment
showed that a period of about half an hour
was necessary to lead to the impregnation of the
neighbourhood with the effluvium she elaborated.</p>

<p class='c012'>The obvious test was employed of trying to
drown the supposed odour of the female by
filling the room she was in with powerful aromas,
like naphthaline, paraffin, the alkaline sulphides,
and the like. But in spite of the presence of these
stenches, in our experience overwhelming to
fainter exhalations, the males still continued to
arrive in droves. This result led Fabre to doubt
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>whether it could really have been an odour that
attracted them. But surely this negative conclusion
ignores the possibility of the moths being
anosmic to these gross scents while highly
specialised for one particular olfactory stimulus
to which, as a matter of fact, we ourselves are
wholly insensitive.</p>

<p class='c011'>Apart from this particular problem, however,
to which we return below, biologists agree that
insects undoubtedly possess an olfactory sense
capable of appreciating the same kind of odours
as ours does. Lubbock, for example, demonstrated
that ants give signs of perceiving the
presence of musk and other perfumes. There is
no doubt, indeed, that the olfactory sense plays
a great, it may be a preponderating part in their
life-activity.</p>

<p class='c012'>The olfactory organ of insects is situated at the
bottom of little crypts in the antennæ and in the
palpi of the mouth apparatus, more particularly
in the antennæ. And those insects, like bees,
wasps, butterflies and moths, that frequent
flowers, are attracted to them by their perfumes as
well as by their colours. It has been found, for
example, that covering up flowers from view does
not put a stop to the visits of insects. Some
naturalists go so far, indeed, as to say that odour
is their principal guide. At all events, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>sarcophagic and stercophagic insects are attracted
to their food chiefly, if not entirely, by odour.
Fabre has recorded how such insects are lured to
their death by certain insectivorous plants which
exhale a smell like that of putrid beef.</p>

<p class='c012'>In this connection I may interpolate here an
experience which shows that this class of insect may
be attracted solely by odour. Incidentally, it also
manifests how the olfactory sense of insects can
be utilised in the matter of hygiene.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class='c012'>A clever plumber of my acquaintance was once called to
a large drapery establishment in the West End of London,
because the dressmakers at work in one of the rooms were
making complaints of an evil smell that haunted the place.
So much had they been troubled, indeed, that several of
them had been made ill by it. On examining the workroom
my friend found everything apparently faultless. It was a
large, well-lighted and airy apartment, and he himself was
unable to detect anything amiss in the atmosphere. Plans
were consulted, but no evidence could be found of any
possible source of unpleasant odour. His opinion therefore
was, that the ladies were—ladies, that is to say, fanciful,
and the matter was dropped. But the ladies were not consenting
parties to this opinion, and the complaints continued.
More of the assistants fell ill as a consequence, they said, of
the smell, so that he was again sent for. On this occasion,
it being the height of summer, he called, on his way to the
draper’s emporium, at a butcher’s shop, and much to that
man’s surprise, asked permission to capture a few of his
bluebottle flies. These he took with him to the draper’s,
and, the suspected room having been emptied of furniture
and occupants, he closed all the windows and doors and
released his flies. After waiting patiently for some time,
he observed that these amateur detectives of his had all
made for one part of the room, where they were settling on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>the wall. Here he had an opening made, and found hidden
behind the plaster an open drain-pipe, old and foul, which
had formerly been connected with a lavatory, and had been
enclosed and forgotten during some alterations made on the
building several years before.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class='c012'>The olfactory sense of insects has been credited
with perhaps even more wonderful powers than
those we have just been writing about. For
instance, both Lubbock and Forel have shown that
the extraordinary aptitude ants possess for finding
their way back to their nest after their peregrinations
in the mazy labyrinth of their world depends
upon the sense of smell. On their return to the
nest they follow the scent left by their own
footsteps.</p>

<p class='c012'>This “homing” instinct, or “orientation,”
which is found in many species of insects and
animals, has long been a matter of interest to
scientific naturalists. The subject is, however,
much too large for us to enter fully into on the
present occasion.</p>

<p class='c012'>Winged insects like bees and wasps manifest
also the homing instinct. In their case the return
to the nest or hive is effected probably altogether
under the guidance of vision. This is what we
should expect, as elevation in the air secures for
these creatures a wide and unimpeded view of
their world. Circumstances are obviously different
in the case of ants and other creeping things,
whose immediate outlook, like that of four-footed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>mammals, is circumscribed to an area of but
a few inches or feet at the most.</p>

<p class='c012'>Investigating the orientation of ants, Forel
found, first of all, that while the covering of their
eyes with an opaque varnish “embarrassed”
them to some extent, they went hopelessly astray
when their antennæ were removed.</p>

<p class='c012'>He also repeated Lubbock’s well-known experiments
of supplying the ants with bridges over
obstacles in the neighbourhood of their nests,
noting their behaviour when the bridges were
changed, removed, or reversed, with the result
that he came to credit the olfactory system of
ants with much greater powers than the more
cautious Lubbock would have believed.</p>

<p class='c012'>These insects, says Forel, exploring with their
mobile antennæ the fields of odour they encounter,
form in their memory a kind of “chemical topography.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Thus when an ant sets out from her nest she
distinguishes the various odours and varying
strengths of odours she comes upon, noting and
memorising them as in two main fields, one on her
left side, the other on her right. In order to find
her way back again all she has to do is to unwind,
so to speak, the roll in her memory, transposing
right and left, and this successfully accomplished
will bring her back to the point she started from.</p>

<p class='c012'>If, he concludes, we ourselves were endowed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>with such a perfect olfactory mechanism situated
in long, flexible whip-lashes, which we could move
and tap with each step, the world for us would be
transformed. Odour would become a sense of
forms. Thus the orientation of ants can be
explained without assuming the existence of an
unknown sense. (It has recently been suggested,
by the way, that bats owe the exquisite power they
manifest of steering their flight among obstacles
to the use of their squeaks, the echoes from which
enable them to form “sound-pictures” of their
environment. In the same way a blind man in the
street tapping the pavement with his stick forms
a more or less well-defined sound-picture of the
walls, doorways, and alleys about him.)</p>

<p class='c011'>In the immediately foregoing paragraphs we
have been dealing with the ability of insects to
smell the smells that we smell. But Fabre’s
experiments have familiarised us also with the
notion that there are insects which can smell smells
we cannot smell.</p>

<p class='c012'>We shall see in the following section that the
same may also be true of some of the higher
animals.</p>

<p class='c011'>In fish olfaction is, unlike that of air-breathing
animals, effected by odorous material in solution.
Whether or not their olfactory sense is as acute it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>is impossible in the present state of our knowledge
to say. Anatomically the end-organ of fishes is
simpler, but there are some species, the dog-fishes
for example, which possess a large olfactory lobe
in the brain; and this certainly suggests that they,
at all events, are gifted with an olfactory sense of
relatively high development.</p>

<p class='c012'>Experiment on fish is difficult, nevertheless it
has been definitely proved that they do smell, and
it seems probable that the sense is used by them
for food-perception. Moreover, that it may be
highly sensitive seems likely from the fact that
sharks (which belong to the same order as dog-fish)
can be attracted from great distances to
putrid meat thrown into the water as bait, the high
dilution of which resembles the behaviour of odour
in an air medium.</p>

<p class='c012'>The belief that life in water, however, is less
favourable than life on land to the fullest development
of the sense is supported by the fact we have
already mentioned that mammals living in water
are extremely microsmatic.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the macrosmatic terrestrial animals not only
is the olfactory sense relatively highly organised,
but it is absolutely the predominant sense. Vision
is subsidiary to it. In their brains the olfactory
region constitutes by far the largest component.
(The same, by the way, is true of the Reptilia.)</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>In other words, it is upon the olfactory sense
that these animals chiefly depend for their knowledge
of the world. By it they are directed to their
food, warned of their enemies, and attracted to
their mates. Their universe is a universe of odour.</p>

<p class='c012'>In order to become more intimate with the
details of this part of our subject, we shall pass in
review some of the olfactory habits and characteristics
of the macrosmatic animal most familiar
to us, namely, the dog.</p>

<p class='c012'>There can be no doubt of the all-important part
that smell plays in the life of the dog. Every one
is familiar with it, and yet we do not often stop to
think what its meaning is for the canine brain and
understanding. One of the mysteries that must,
one would suppose, for ever remain hidden from
us, is what aspect the world we both share in company
bears to this our closest animal friend. Who
can tell what is passing through his mind as he
sniffs at us? He can recognise his master by sight,
no doubt, yet, as we know, he is never perfectly
satisfied until he has taken stock also of the scent,
the more precisely to do so bringing his snout into
actual contact with the person he is examining.
It is as if his eyes might deceive him, but never his
nose.</p>

<p class='c012'>The greyhound courses by sight, but all other
dogs hunt by scent, and the speed and certainty
of foxhounds in full cry bear a new significance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>when we recollect that it is scent that is directing
them. Could vision be any more swift and sure?</p>

<p class='c012'>We may heartily wish, as a child once remarked
to a friend of mine, that Rover had a prettier way
of saying “How d’ye do?” to his canine friends.
But that and other even more objectionable
habits do not prevent his <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">entrée</span></i> into the most
exclusive circles of human society. He is taken
at his own valuation, and that, to be sure, is considerable.
But the minute, the meticulous, olfactory
scrutiny he makes of other dogs is but one more
example of the predominance of this sense in his
brain. (See also later.)</p>

<p class='c011'>When you take him for a walk also, how busy
his nose makes him! Burrowing here and there
among the grass and undergrowth, picking up an
interesting trail that leads him a little way, until
it crosses another, fresher, perhaps, or more
interesting, that has to be taken up—here a cat’s,
there a rat’s, further on a rabbit’s, and then, with
short squeals, scrapings in the ground, and buryings
of his muzzle, a weasel’s!—the whole intermixed
and intermingled with whiffs of something
like old decayed bones, or of another and an unfriendly
dog, or of some ardent lady-love who has
passed this way but shortly since!—is not this a
richer, a fuller, a more attractive, world than ours,
with its fickle sunlight, its pallid greys, its mournful
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>purples, its unattainable horizon-blue? For our
life is primarily one of vision.</p>

<p class='c012'>I am sure his dreams, also, are compounded of
the gorgeous odours of some other world, such
odours as even our woods in autumn know
nothing of.</p>

<p class='c011'>But we must return again to science and Fabre.
This time we shall accompany him on an excursion
with the wonderful dog who is trained to discover
for the <em>gourmet</em> the truffles that are growing deep
in the soil.</p>

<p class='c012'>Left to his own devices, we learn, the truffle-hunting
dog indicates the position not only of
truffles, but also of all manner of hypogean (underground)
fungi, “the large and the small, the fresh
and the putrid, the scented and the unscented, the
fragrant and the stinking.” Only, he never at any
time indicates the presence of the ordinary mushroom,
not even while it is still underground, before
it sprouts up as the fungus we know. And yet to
our nostrils the mushroom has the same smell as
many of the hypogean fungi he does indicate.
Consequently, therefore, the dog is not guided to
the deep fungi by what may be called the general
odour common to all fungi. He must be able,
that is to say, to distinguish the hypogean varieties
by some quality which is not odour, or, at least,
not odour as we understand it.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>There is, as it happens, something like a truffle-hunter
among the insects also, what is known as
the Bolboceros beetle. This little creature feeds
on the <em>hydnocystis arenaria</em>, a hypogean fungus.
Fabre, having captured some of these insects,
placed them on earth in which he had buried the
fungus at depths of six or seven inches. It was
found that the beetles, without making any trial
bores, sank vertical shafts through the soil direct
to their food.</p>

<p class='c012'>We may insert here also, as bearing upon the
problem which is now emerging into clearness, an
observation and a suggestion similar, as we shall
see, to that of Fabre, on the badger by Mr. Douglas
Gordon (<cite>Spectator</cite>, August 6th, 1921):</p>

<blockquote>
<p class='c012'>“The real damage wrought by the badger is microscopic.
His diet mainly consists of roots, green herbs, mice, frogs,
and insects. Like the fox, he has a great partiality for
whorts and blackberries when in season, and he is particularly
fond of grubs. For the sake of these he will dig
out every wasp’s nest he can find. A considerable number
of rabbit ‘stops’ also fall to his share, and in unearthing the
latter he practises a somewhat remarkable piece of woodcraft.
The hole which contains the nest may run to the
depth of several feet, and the nest itself be situated ten feet
from any entrance, but this does not trouble the badger.
He makes no attempt to follow the tortuous passage, as a
man when digging would be obliged to do. His unerring
nose locates the exact spot where the young rabbits lie, and
from the most convenient point he bores for them. Should
it be a ‘ground-burrow,’ he sinks a vertical shaft. In the
case of a steep bank he drives a horizontal tunnel, and,
shallow or deep, with unvarying accuracy.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>“Not long ago I saw a striking case of this on Haldon
Hill, near Exeter. The burrow opened on to a little gully,
and ran back some distance under the heath. At least five
paces from the nearest hole was the badger’s freshly cut
shaft, about three feet deep, and around it were littered the
ruins of the nest—the little tale of bloodstained fur so
eloquent of tragedy. There on the earth drawn from the
shaft the raider’s spoor was plain enough, but no imprint of
his pads could I find upon the impressionable mould anywhere
near the holes. This meant that he must have found
the nest while traversing the heather—sensed it beneath
him, in fact. And here an interesting point arises. What
sense did he employ? Could he possibly ‘smell’ the
rabbits through three feet of packed mould? Earth is a
potent deodoriser. Do certain animals possess a sixth
sense—a sympathy something akin to that of the divining
rod? If so, this goes farther to explain the much-discussed
principle of scent than anything yet suggested.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p class='c012'>Is this sense, then, as we see it in operation in
the badger, in the truffle-hunting dog, in the
Bolboceros beetle, and still more wonderfully in
the Peacock and Banded Monk moths, drawn to
their mates “from the edge of the horizon,” and,
it may be, against the wind—is this sense the same
as our own sense of olfaction, only much more
acute? Fabre finds some difficulty in believing
that it can really be the same. “Odour,” he
argues, “is molecular diffusion.” But nothing
material, nothing our senses can perceive, is
emitted by these moths, and yet they can summon
their mates from relatively enormous distances.
However fine may be the divisibility of matter,
Fabre’s mind refuses to entertain the suggestion
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>that this far-flung summons is addressed to a
sense of smell of the same nature as ours. It
would be tantamount, he says, “to reddening a
lake with an atom of carmine, to filling immensity
with nothing.”</p>

<p class='c012'>It is impossible not to sympathise with this
opinion, but caution compels us to say that for
the most striking of these observations, that of
the calling of the males against a high wind, we
should like to have confirmation by some independent
observer.</p>

<p class='c012'>Besides, I think perhaps Fabre would have
hesitated to express his scepticism regarding the
power of insect olfaction had he known more of
the marvels of the human sense.</p>

<p class='c012'>Vanillin, for example, is perceptible by us as
a smell when it amounts to no more than
0·000000005 gram in a litre of air; and we can
perceive mercaptan, a substance with a garlicky
odour, in a dilution of 1/460,000,000 of a milligram
in fifty cubic centimetres of air (approximately
0·0000000026 of a grain in a little over
three cubic inches of air!) (See also p. <a href='#Page_108'>108</a>.)</p>

<p class='c012'>What is this but immensity filled with nothing?
And yet we, even we, microsmatic though we are,
can perceive that “nothing.”</p>

<p class='c012'>But we must pick up again the thread of Fabre’s
argument. Baffled as he feels himself to be when
he regards olfaction in the light of these observations
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>of his, he goes on: “For emission substitute
undulation, and the problem of the Great Peacock
is explained. Without losing any of its substance
a luminous point shakes the ether with its vibrations
and fills a circle<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c017'><sup>[1]</sup></a> of indefinite width with
light....</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f1'>
<p class='c012'><a href='#r1'>1</a>. A sphere rather.</p>
</div>

<p class='c012'>“It does not emit molecules; it vibrates; it
sets in motion waves capable of spreading to
distances incompatible with a real diffusion of
matter.</p>

<p class='c012'>“In its entirety smell would thus seem to have
two domains: that of particles dissolved in the
air and that of ethereal waves. The first alone is
known to us....</p>

<p class='c012'>“The second, which is far superior in its range
through space, escapes us altogether, because we
lack the necessary sensory equipment. The Great
Peacock and the Banded Monk know it at the
time of the nuptial rejoicings. And many others
must share it in various degrees according to the
exigencies of their mode of life.”</p>

<p class='c012'>In criticism of this conclusion of Fabre, however,
we must again draw attention to the fact that
in the case of the Greater Peacock he found that
a plug of cotton-wool was sufficient to prevent
the emanation leaving the immediate neighbourhood
of the female, a circumstance strongly in
favour of some material exhalation which was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>caught and held by the cotton-wool filter. Again,
in the case of the Banded Monk, the suggestion
of odour is unmistakable in the tainting, as it were,
of substances in her vicinity with her emanation.
Further, if the guide to the males were something
like a luminous undulation we should expect that,
like the Bolboceros beetle and the badger, there
would have been no blundering and going astray;
they would have precipitated themselves straight
on to the female, or as near to her as they could get.</p>

<p class='c012'>Moreover, although we are ourselves unable to
detect any odorous emanation, may not our
inability be due simply to the fact that our
olfactory hairs are not susceptible to this particular
stimulus? It may be of the same nature
as odour, and yet we may be unable to perceive
it, just as the moths themselves seemed anosmic
to what we would call the stenches Fabre filled
his room with.</p>

<p class='c011'>These critical questions seem to me to be
difficult to answer. Nevertheless, our imagination
is certainly staggered by the fact of a tiny
creature like a moth being able to disseminate
in the immensity of atmospheric space an odour
capable of perception at such great distances as
a mile or a mile and a half. Hero, with the Great
Peacock’s power, could have summoned Leander
from a hundred miles away.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>Apart, however, from such considerations for
and against his opinions, one of the modern
theories of odour, and of odour belonging to
Fabre’s first, or material, order, is, as we shall see
later on, that even it is a vibratory and not a
material quality.</p>

<p class='c012'>But leaving that development aside, and admitting
for the moment the validity of Fabre’s
contentions, I am bold enough to ask: Are we
human beings so ignorant of the second domain
of olfaction as he supposes? Is it true that we
are, as he says, lacking in the equipment necessary
for the exploration of that mysterious region?
To answering these questions we shall presently
address ourselves. In the meantime, I may forestall
what I shall then say by remarking that I
count it a very remarkable circumstance, if not,
indeed, a significant coincidence, that, before I
had become acquainted with Fabre’s writings, I
had, considering the phenomena of human olfaction
and psychology alone, actually asked myself
the same question as he asks, and had come to
very much the same conclusion.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>
  <h2 class='c010'>CHAPTER III<br /> <span class='large'>OLFACTORY MEMORY</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The predominant special senses in man are
vision and hearing, olfaction occupying a quite
unimportant position in the scale.</p>

<p class='c012'>Smell and taste, by the way, are usually regarded
not only as allied senses, but also as if they were
akin in their nature and function. Allied they are,
undoubtedly, seeing that both subserve the function
of food-perception. But the resemblance
ends there. For, of the two, smell is at once the
more delicate and the more extensive in capacity,
and, as they differ widely in their anatomical
structure, there can be no doubt but that in
physiological action also they are dissimilar.</p>

<p class='c012'>The taste-bulbs are capable of appreciating
four sensations only, and these quite simple,
while the capacity of the olfactory organ, as we
shall see more fully later on, is practically unlimited.
All the subtlety of “taste,” all that we
call “flavour,” is an olfactory sensation. Thus,
people devoid of the sense of smell cannot discern
the finer savours. They would be unable to
distinguish, say, a vanilla from a strawberry ice.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>All they could tell would be that both were cold
and sweet.</p>

<p class='c012'>The popular phrase which refers the appreciation
of the finer shades of taste to the “palate”
we may therefore look upon as an attempt to
express the feeling that delicate flavours are
sensed somewhere higher up than in the mouth.
So that a “man of taste” is really a man of smell,
and all the literary eloquence in praise of wine
and dainty food, to say nothing of the more prosy
cookery books, is, in reality, a general hymn of
adulation offered unwittingly to the nose!</p>

<p class='c011'>Compared with sight and hearing, however,
smell in man is only one of the minor senses.
But, as if to make up for a position so inferior, it
is remarkable as being the most subtle of all
our senses, possibly, as some hold, because of
the ancestral appeal to our (more or less repressed)
animal nature. So subtle is it, indeed, that I am
persuaded its stimuli may not, on occasion,
emerge into consciousness at all. They remain
below the threshold. So that, although subjected
to their influence, we may remain ignorant of the
cause of that influence. For smell often operates
powerfully, not only in surreptitiously enriching
and invigorating the mental impression of an
event, but also in directing at times the flow of
ideas into some particular channel independent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>of the will. The influence of the perfume of a
woman’s hair in unexpectedly arousing a feeling
of intimacy will appeal to the male reader as a
good example of this upsurging interference with
the placid flow of normal ideation.</p>

<p class='c012'>Perhaps, also, this is the explanation of a strange
and rather unpleasant ghost-story I once heard. I
dare not vouch for the truth of it, but as it bears
upon the subject we are considering, I give it here,
not without misgiving, for what it is worth. For
the sake of verisimilitude I shall relate it pretty
much in the narrator’s own words:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class='c012'>“The evening he came back I was sitting in my room
alone. I had just got back from the play, the subject of
which had been, it so happened, the influence of people
recently dead upon those left behind. I suppose that’s
what turned my mind to my sorrow of the previous year
when I lost him. It is my husband I am talking about.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I was sitting gazing at the fire, and I expect you will say
I had fallen asleep. Perhaps I had. It doesn’t matter
really.</p>

<p class='c012'>“We had been happy enough together, he and I. Just
an ordinary married couple, you might say. But now and
then a terrible longing would come over me just to see him
once more,&nbsp;... to hear him speak,&nbsp;... to touch him....
I know it is selfish, and maybe unwise, to give way to those
feelings,&nbsp;... but never mind that! Well, on the night I
am telling you about, there came to my recollection some of
the silly cantrips those Spiritualist people used to carry on.
Oh, yes, it is quite true: I had gone once or twice to see
them, and had even taken part in their services—séances,
I should say—in James’s lifetime, I mean, before he died.
Indeed I went with him.... I never went after.... I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>don’t know.... It seemed to me like trifling somehow.
Anyhow I have never gone since.</p>

<p class='c012'>“All the same there came into my head a curious jingling
rhyme I had heard them repeat once or twice, because they
said somebody called Plato or Plautus or something had
used it. It would bring back the dead, so they used to say,
if you recited it alone at midnight, and accompanied it with
certain gestures. The words are nothing but gibberish, a
jumbled sort of.... No, I’m not going to repeat them....
Let me go on.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Before I had realised what I was doing, without stopping
to think, I uttered the words aloud, moving my arms so as
to follow the ritual. Scarcely were the syllables out of my
mouth—it closes with the name and the clock was striking
twelve as I spoke it—scarcely, I say, were the words out of
my mouth when—God! the pang comes yet when I think
of it!—I heard the latch-key going into the hall door, and
the door slowly opening—I was alone in the flat, and—oh!
I can never tell you! I felt dreadful!—I didn’t know how
to undo the thing, and yet I knew it was wrong—wicked—I
never for a moment thought.—Perhaps it had been my
longing so much.—The hall door opened.—The chain wasn’t
up.—I heard a step,—a cough—oh! the usual sounds he
used to make when he came in.—What would he be like?—What...?
what...?</p>

<p class='c012'>“Then the door of the room opened, and there he stood,
swinging himself backwards and forwards, half toes, half
heels, in a way he had, and replacing his jingling keys in his
trouser-pocket—I could only stare at him speechless, and
gasp—till suddenly he stretched out his hand and pointed
at me with a&nbsp;... a sort of snarl.</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘Good heavens, Jane!’—the words sounded so commonplace
that every trace of the unearthly was dissipated at the
first syllable.—‘Good heavens, Jane! Go and change that
frock!—How often have I told you what a fright you look
in mauve.—A mill-girl on a holiday!—Come! Get along
and change it!’</p>

<p class='c012'>“It seems silly, I daresay, and all that, but, do you know,
no sooner did I hear him growling and grumbling and finding
fault with colours he had a dozen times at least admired
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>and praised than—I couldn’t help it!—I forgot everything—everything.
And all I could say was:</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘James! You’ve been eating onions again!’</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘Not my fault, I assure you, my dear,’ he snapped back;
‘that damned cook always will put garlic in the nectar!
You must get rid of her.’</p>

<p class='c011'>“... I suppose I must have fainted then, for I remember
no more till I found myself lying on the floor with my head on
the fender. I picked myself up very puzzled as to what had
happened. Then I remembered my&nbsp;... dream, with a
shock rather of amusement than fear, when suddenly—suddenly
I smelled the nauseating stench of strong garlic!
That finished me entirely. How I got out of the place I
cannot tell. Out I did get. And I have never gone back.”</p>

<p class='c012'>This lady evidently would not have subscribed
to the old teaching of Salerno:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Six things that heere in order shall issue</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>(It may be remembered, by the way, that Wilkie
Collins’s “Haunted Hotel” was haunted by a
smell.)</p>

<p class='c012'>Although we may agree with Shelley that</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Odours when sweet violets sicken</div>
      <div class='line'>Live within the sense they quicken,”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>yet we must admit that the memory of an
odour cannot be reproduced in our mind with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>the same clearness as a vanished scene or an
old tune.</p>

<p class='c012'>It may be found on trial that by concentrating
the attention strongly upon some familiar smell,
particularly if at the same time we stimulate the
memory by picturing in our mind’s eye a scene in
which that odour figured as a feature in the sensory
landscape, we are sometimes able to recall its
actual sensation. But the recollection lacks the
intimate reality of visual and auditory images.
Without doubt the mind’s eye and mind’s ear,
when consciously aroused, are consistently more
acute and their representations are more vivid
than those of the mind’s olfactory organ.</p>

<p class='c012'>When, for instance, I call to memory the
drawing-room of my boyhood days, I can once
more catch a faint reminiscence of the acid-sweet
rose-leaves that filled it with perennial fragrance,
but not until I have first of all recalled its pale
greys and blues and its over-bright windows, not
until I have listened once more to “The March of
the Troubadours” my mother is playing on the
old rosewood piano, like a call to some life greater,
grander, and, above all, more simple than this
bewildering affair!</p>

<p class='c012'>People, Ribot has ascertained, vary considerably
in their power of resuscitating dead perfumes.
According to his statistics, 40 per cent. could not
revive any image at all; 48 per cent. could recall
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>some, but not all; and only 12 per cent. could
recall all or nearly all at pleasure. The odours
most easy to bring back were pinks, musk, violet,
heliotrope, carbolic acid, the smell of the country,
grass, and so on. Many, as in my own case, have
to evoke the visual image first.</p>

<p class='c011'>But if the recollection of a scene can only with
difficulty, or not at all, revive the sensation of an
odour, the converse is most startlingly true. For
odours have an extraordinary, an inexplicable,
power of spontaneously and suddenly presenting a
forgotten scene to the mind, and with such nearness
to reality that we are translated bodily, being
caught up by the spirit, as it were, like St. Philip,
to be placed once more in the midst of the old past
life, where we live the moment over again with the
full chord of its emotions vibrating our soul and
startling our consciousness. There are, it is true,
certain sounds which wield the same miraculous
power over our being—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“... the chime familiar of a bell</div>
      <div class='line'>Last heard at sea, but now on homely ground,</div>
      <div class='line'>Can, with the sprites that deep in memory dwell,</div>
      <div class='line'>Create the world anew with stroke of sound,</div>
      <div class='line'>Transforming daisied fields to foaming seas,</div>
      <div class='line'>And changing vales from summer calm serene</div>
      <div class='line'>To warring tides round wintry Hebrides</div>
      <div class='line'>That fling and toss in wat’ry hillocks green”—</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>but I do not think they operate in this way so
frequently as do smells.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>This strange revival of bygone days by olfaction
is, as I have said, automatic. It is most clearly and
completely to be realised when the inciting odour
comes upon us unawares, and then as in a dream
the whole of the long-forgotten incident is displayed,
even although it may have been an incident
in which the odour itself was not specially obtrusive.
Yet the display is not only a spectacle, for
we become, as I have already laboured to point
out, once more actors in the old life-drama.</p>

<p class='c012'>Now memory can nearly always be recognised
as memory. There is about its representations a
dulling in colour, a haziness in outline, a vagueness
in detail, that serves to distinguish it from the
harder, clearer pictures of the imagination. Its
figures and their doings are like ghosts; through
them you can see the solid furniture of to-day.
But from the olfactory miracle we are now considering
the effect of time, the fraying effect of
time and superimposed incident, is absent. That
is still fresh, still, as we might say, in process of
elaboration, the manifold and complicated experiences
we have undergone since its occurrence being
blotted for the moment out of the mind.</p>

<p class='c012'>Curiously enough, although Ribot finds that
about 60 per cent. of people experience the “spontaneous”
revival of odour in memory, and so
presumably are subject to this arresting phenomenon,
it does not seem to have been mentioned
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>by writers in general until about our own time.
At all events, the earliest allusion I can find to it is
in “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Les Fleurs du Mal</span>” of Baudelaire:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Lecteur, as-tu quelquefois respiré</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Avec ivresse et lente gourmandise</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ce grain d’encens qui remplit une église</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ou d’un sachet le musc invétéré?</span></div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Charme profond, magique, dont nous grise</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Dans le présent le passé restauré</span>”....</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>Shortly after Baudelaire’s time Bret Harte, on
the other side of the Atlantic, imported it into
“The Newport Romance”:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“But the smell of that subtle, sad perfume,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>As the spiced embalmings, they say, outlast</div>
      <div class='line'>The mummy laid in his rocky tomb,</div>
      <div class='line in4'>Awakes my buried past.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“And I think of the passion that shook my youth,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Of its aimless loves and its idle pains,</div>
      <div class='line'>And am thankful now of the certain truth</div>
      <div class='line in4'>That only the sweet remains.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>But the most precise and definite allusion to this
curious power of odours seems to have first been
made by Oliver Wendell Holmes in “The Autocrat
of the Breakfast Table.” Here is what he
says, and it will be noted that he makes as high
a claim for the power of olfaction as I have
done:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class='c012'>“Memory, imagination, old sentiments and associations,
are more readily reached through the sense of <span class='fss'>SMELL</span> than
by almost any other channel.”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>“Phosphorus fires this train of associations in an instant;
its luminous vapours with their penetrating odour throw me
into a trance; it comes to me in a double sense, ‘trailing
clouds of glory.’”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Perhaps the herb <em>everlasting</em>, the fragrant <em>immortelle</em>
of our autumn fields, has the most suggestive odour to me
of all those that set me dreaming. I can hardly describe
the strange thoughts and emotions that come to me as I
inhale the aroma of the pale, dry, rustling flowers. A something
it has of sepulchral spicery, as if it had been brought
from the core of some great pyramid, where it had lain on
the breast of a mummied Pharaoh. Something, too, of
immortality in the sad, faint sweetness lingering so long in
its lifeless petals. Yet this does not tell why it fills my eyes
with tears and carries me in blissful thought to the banks of
asphodel that border the River of Life.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p class='c012'>In introducing the subject, Holmes states that
he has “occasionally met with something like it in
books, somewhere in Bulwer’s novels,&nbsp;... and
in one of the works of Mr. Olmstead.”</p>

<p class='c011'>When one considers the obvious poetic appeal
of this psychic phenomenon as exemplified in the
touching expressions we have just quoted, it seems
strange that the older writers made no use of it.</p>

<p class='c012'>Even omniscient Shakespeare, although odorous
images and allusions are not uncommon in his
works, seems to have overlooked this sportive
trick of the sense. Otherwise we might have had
Lady Macbeth sleep-walking because her nightposset
exhaled the vapour of the draught she had
drugged Duncan’s guards with.</p>

<p class='c012'>Several seventeenth century writers make a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>general reference to odours as “strengthening the
memory.” Here is one for which I am indebted
to my friend F. W. Watkyn-Thomas:</p>

<blockquote>
<div class='lg-container-l'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“<span class='sc'>Olfactus</span> (<em>loq.</em>)—</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Hence do I likewise minister perfume</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Unto the neighbour brain, perfume of force,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>To cleanse your head, and make your fancy bright</div>
      <div class='line in2'>To refine wit and sharp invention,</div>
      <div class='line in2'><em>And strengthen memory</em>: from whence it came</div>
      <div class='line in2'>That old devotion incense did ordain</div>
      <div class='line in2'>To make man’s spirit more apt for things divine....”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>(“Lingua, or the Combat of the Tongue and the
Five Senses,” Act IV., Sc. 5, Anthony Brewer
(<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">circa</span></i> 1600): Dodsley’s “Old Plays,” Vol. V.,
p. 179, 1825.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p class='c016'>And Montaigne may be alluding to it when he
says:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class='c012'>“Physicians might (in my opinion) draw more use and
good from odours than they do. For myself have often
perceived, that according unto their strength and qualitie,
<em>they change and alter, and move my spirit, and worke strange
effects in me</em>: Which makes me approve the common saying,
that invention of incense and perfumes in Churches, so
ancient and so far-dispersed throughout all nations and
religions, had an especiall regard to rejoyce, to comfort, to
quicken and to rowze and to purifie our senses,&nbsp;...”</p>
</blockquote>

<p class='c012'>The Jacobean herbalists and therapeutists in
general, as we shall see later on, frequently
credit aromatics with the power of strengthening
the memory. But, so far as my reading
goes, I have failed to find a clear and unmistakable
description of this peculiar phenomenon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>in any writer prior to the nineteenth century. It
is, of course, difficult to prove a negative, and so
it would not be surprising if some such allusion
were to be dug up. But even then the wonder
would remain that it had attracted little, if any,
attention from others. As a matter of fact, mental
happenings of this order did not interest our forebears
much. Shakespeare is the exception to
this statement, and that is one of his claims to
greatness.</p>

<p class='c011'>Moreover, quite apart from this particular, the
writings of the old English poets and of such
French and German authors as I am acquainted
with, seem curiously deficient in references to all
but the more gross and obvious phenomena of
olfaction, and these are most frequently of the
farcical order, a little too gross and obvious for
modern readers.</p>

<p class='c012'>Since Dickens’s time, however, we have had
almost too much literary odour.</p>

<p class='c012'>I do not agree with the purists who deny to
Dickens the glory of a great writer of English
prose. Dickens was an impressionist, perhaps the
first and certainly the greatest of this school, and
as such he was a master. Few equal and none
surpass him in the rare vigour of scene, and
portrait-painting. And it is significant to find
him using the aroma of the place and also of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>the person to impart life and reality to his
description.</p>

<p class='c012'>Take for example, to cite but one out of many
olfactory references in his books, the humorous
analysis of the smells in various London churches
in “The Uncommercial Traveller.” One congregation
furnishes “an agreeable odour of
pomatum,” while in the others “rat and mildew
and dead citizens” seemed to be the fundamentals,
to which in some localities was added “in a
dreamy way not at all displeasing” the staple
character of the neighbourhood. “A dry whiff of
wheat” circulated about Mark Lane, and he
“accidentally struck an airy sample of barley out
of an aged hassock” in another. The reader’s
throat begins at once to feel dry.</p>

<p class='c012'>Then note how Mr. E. W. B. Childers starts
from the page the moment his creator breathes
into our nostrils a breath of his life:—“a smell of
lamp oil, straw, orange-peel, horses’ provender,
and sawdust.”</p>

<p class='c012'>I could fill this book with olfactory citations
from Dickens alone. But to come to contemporary
writers, those of Rudyard Kipling are almost as
plentiful, the smell that brings places to the mind
being a favourite with him. But I have always
wondered how it came about that the highly
sensitive nose of Mr. Kipling permitted Imray’s
corpse on the rafters above the ceiling-cloth to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>remain undiscovered for as long as three months.
This in India. The bungalow, we gather, was
haunted. It would be.</p>

<p class='c012'>Nevertheless, in spite of the keen olfaction of
both of those writers, neither of them, as far as I
can remember, weaves the memory-reviving power
of olfaction into a plot. We come across it,
however, in foreign literature, as in the suggestive
play made with the smell of lamp-oil in Dostoievsky’s
“Crime and Punishment.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The more recent English and foreign writers,
however, give us a surfeit of odours—as if to prove
their superiority in this as in all else.</p>

<p class='c011'>It seems strange, moreover, that the theatre
should have overlooked this avenue to the memory
and imagination of its audiences. The ancient
Romans, to be sure, during the gladiatorial
games, used to perfume the atmosphere of the
Colosseum, whether to counteract the raw smell
of dust, blood, and sweat, it were hard to say,
as these rank odours play their part, again subtly,
in stimulating the slaughterous passions of
mankind.</p>

<p class='c012'>But our modern theatre, which a prominent
Scots ecclesiastic of the nineteenth century
characterised as redolent only of “orange-peel,
sawdust, and vice,” has not yet risen to anything
higher than a continuous discharge of incense
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>during spectacular dramas depicting the (theatrical)
East.</p>

<p class='c012'>Why not go further? Think how the appeal of
a love-scene would be strengthened by an invisible
cloud of roses blown into the house through the
ventilating shafts! The villain would be heralded
by an olfactory <em>motif</em> of a brimstony flavour
mingled, if he was of the usual swarthy countenance,
with a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">soupçon</span></i> of garlic. The hero, well
groomed and clean-limbed, would waft a delicate
suggestion of Brown Windsor to the love-sick
maidens in the dress-circle. The heavy father
would radiate snuff with his red pocket-handkerchief.
The large-eyed foreign adventuress would
permeate the auditorium on wings of patchouli.
The dear broken-hearted old mother would disseminate
that most respectable of perfumes (for
there is a caste-system among smells) eau de
Cologne—a scent that always evokes in my mind a
darkened room, tiptoes, hushed voices, raised
forefingers, and Somebody in bed with a—headache.</p>

<p class='c012'>And so on. Here is a new way of “putting it
over.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Critics will object that, as the influence of eau
de Cologne on my own mind shows, the particular
odours so supplied would defeat their purpose by
calling up a thousand different and incongruous
images in the thousand minds of the audience.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>But such mischances could easily be avoided by
conventionalising the odours after the manner
already familiar in the stock gesticulations of our
players, all of whom enter, sit down, pull off their
gloves, blow their noses, utter defiance, shed tears,
launch curses, make love, live, die, and are buried,
according to an inveterate, cast-iron ritual.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>
  <h2 class='c010'>CHAPTER IV<br /> <span class='large'>SMELL AND SPEECH</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c011'>That the effect of odour upon the mind is
largely concealed is further illustrated by the
curious fact that our native language does not
possess a terminology descriptive of smells. We
never name an odour; we only say it has a “smell
like” something or another. As a matter of fact,
the same remark was made regarding French by
P. P. Poncelet as long ago as 1755.</p>

<p class='c012'>In this defect smell is unique among the senses.
Even the sense that governs equilibration, of which
the consciousness in normal conditions is never
aware, has furnished us with “giddy” and
“dizzy.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Vision is represented by hundreds of words.
We have, for instance, names not only for the
primary colours red, yellow, and blue, but also for
many of their combinations. (In these remarks
we are not including the modern names given to
the many shades of the synthetic colours.)</p>

<p class='c012'>If we take red as an example, we find scarlet,
crimson, vermilion, and pink. This colour,
indeed, is ranked above all others in the vulgar
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>tongue as having shades, doubtless because red,
being the colour of blood and so of danger, always
makes a strong appeal to the mind, an appeal
which, among the responses, has led to special
names being given to four of its tones.</p>

<p class='c012'>The sense of hearing again, upon which speech
is wholly dependent, has given rise to a multitude
of words, many of them closely imitative of the
sound, or onomatopoetic, with which words
English, like the related German, is richly adorned.</p>

<p class='c012'>Touch also has produced a number of descriptive
epithets—“hot,” “cold,” “wet,” “dry,”
“moist,” “clammy,” “rough,” “smooth,” as
well as those like “heavy” and “light,” from the
deep tactile sensibility.</p>

<p class='c012'>Even taste has its vocabulary, a complete one, as
it happens, since each of the four varieties of taste
has its own appropriate name—“sweet,” “sour,”
“bitter,” and “salt.”</p>

<p class='c012'>But smell is speechless. We can truthfully say
that in our native English language there is not a
single word characterising any one of all the
myriad odours in the world.</p>

<p class='c012'>No doubt there are many words that we do
apply to smells. But they are either borrowed
from the vocabulary of one of the other senses, in
order to describe a state of mind induced by the
smell, or else they originate from some known
odoriferous object.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>Thus in the opening paragraph of this book we
encountered a large number of olfactory words.
But they are all vague; some applying to pleasant,
some to unpleasant, odours. Many of them are
very expressive, for disgust begets strong language.
But although our olfactory vocabulary may be
forceful, it is not discriminative. In other words,
it is an emotional, not an intellectual, vocabulary.</p>

<p class='c012'>These considerations will become more obvious
as we deal with olfactory epithets in detail.</p>

<p class='c012'>Thus smells may be “faint” or “strong,” but
so may any other sensation. And to call a smell
“sweet” leaves it but vague, while at the same
time the epithet is borrowed from the vocabulary
of taste, where its meaning is quite precise.
“Pungent” is also a transposition, this time from
touch, as it is a Latin word signifying “prickly.”</p>

<p class='c012'>In addition to such terms as these we have a
small number of words which we are in the habit
of applying to certain classes of odours. “Musty”
is one of these. This adjective certainly has the
look of a pure English word about it, but, as it
indicates a smell like that of mould, it is probably
derived from the Latin <em>mucidus</em>, mouldy; we
cannot, therefore, claim it to be English any more
than we can claim it to be definite. Perhaps the
puff-balls of our autumn woods supply the best
example of a musty smell.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Mawkish,” however, is certainly English, as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>it is derived from an old word, still used, by the
way, in Scotland—“mauk,” a maggot. “Dank,”
again, means moist, and is the smell of damp, cold
places. “Stuffy” also, which is a modern
application to a smell, is the odour of a close,
badly ventilated room, where we feel oppressed,
as if half stifled.</p>

<p class='c012'>But these words—and there are not many more
of them—are only applied vaguely and to general
classes of odours. We never say of any one in
particular that, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">e.g.</span></i>, “This is the smell called
‘dank,’” in the precise way we can say: “That
colour is green,” or “That sound is a whistle.”</p>

<p class='c012'>We may even go further. We know that the
flavour of things tasted is an olfactory sensation.
Now while language attains to precision in
characterising the sensations of pure taste, as we
have just seen, it is significant that flavours are left
unnamed, except in the manner we have just
explained for olfactory epithets.</p>

<p class='c011'>The scanty number of odorous terms in English
has of late been copiously added to by words
borrowed from other languages, chiefly, it is said,
from the Persian.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Musk,” for instance, is Persian. “Aroma”
is pure Greek, and if Liddell and Scott’s suggested
derivation of <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἄρωμα</span> (a spice) from the Sanscrit
<em>ghrâ</em> (a smell) is correct, then the original meaning
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>of “aromatic” is merely “smelly.” “Mephitic,”
not a popular word even now, comes from the
Latin <em>mephitis</em>, “a foul, pestilential exhalation
from the ground, often sulphury in character, as
from volcanic regions.” The brimstone odour of
the devil—of which more anon—is mephitic.</p>

<p class='c012'>Now we must here discriminate. Etymologists,
delving down among the roots of our spoken
language, come, so they say, to a point at which
even the simplest epithet, even the plainest
description of a sensation, is seen to derive from
some object. Obviously this must be so in the
beginning, whether or not etymologists are always
correct in their particular ascriptions. An adjective
describing, and later denoting, a quality, is generalised
from some object bearing that quality. A
“stony” countenance is a countenance rigid as
stone. So in like manner, we are told, even the
names of colours, deeply embedded in the language
though they be, are ultimately referable to objects
bearing that colour. “Brown,” to take the least
dubitable instance, is the colour of burnt—“brunt”—things,
while “blue,” according to
authority, like the Scots “blae,” means “livid”
really, and is connected with “blow,” being the
colour left after a blow. (But we say “a black
eye”!)</p>

<p class='c012'>Thus the descriptive epithets not only of smell,
but also of sight, are ultimately derived from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>objects. But there is this great difference between
them: the names of colours take us back to near
the original trunk from which the Aryan languages
branch off, whereas the names of odours, to this
day still vague and indeterminate (at least in
popular phraseology), are derived from the spoken
tongue of to-day, or, in some cases, from foreign
languages, and are, therefore, but recent additions.</p>

<p class='c012'>This delay in the naming of classes of odours
justifies the statement made at the outset of this
section that smell is speechless. It shows, in
other words, that although, as we have seen, its
influence upon the mind may be profound, yet
that influence does not extend as far as the speech-centres.
It remains largely in the subconsciousness.</p>

<p class='c011'>We should be guilty of error, however, were we
to conclude that the scantiness of olfactory names
is due to the lack of recognition by the consciousness
of early man of smell in general, or to a failure
to distinguish between different odours, because
savages, in general less discriminating and analytical
than cultured races, have, there is every
reason to believe, a more acute and highly perfected
olfactory sense. It has been reported that
the North American Indian was able to track his
enemy or his game by the scent alone, and Humboldt
has recorded a similar acuteness on the part
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>of the Indians of Peru. While admitting the
marvellous skill of the American Indians in following
up their quarry, most of us will, I imagine, be
inclined to doubt whether its dependence upon
smell is a true inference from the facts observed.
Skill in woodcraft can be brought to such marvellous
perfection that it may seem like magic to the
onlooker—like magic, or like scent!</p>

<p class='c011'>Further, although we are able to distinguish
clearly enough between different odours, the
identification and the naming of odours does not
come easy to us. <em>Parfumeurs</em> and druggists, no
doubt, by the daily education of the sense, attain
to a high degree of skill in this art, but those who
have not cultivated their powers will find it very
difficult, as the amusing parlour-game of guessing
the names of concealed foodstuffs and spices shows.
The difficulty is, like the paucity of olfactory
terms, probably due to an absence of ready communication
between the olfactory and speech
centres in the brain.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>
  <h2 class='c010'>CHAPTER V<br /> <span class='large'>SMELL IN FOLK-LORE, RELIGION, AND HISTORY</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Evidence of olfactory influences is encountered
in folk-lore not infrequently, particularly in connection
with primitive medicine, and survivals of
old olfactory methods of treatment are still extant,
not only in the doings of the wise women of our
remoter country villages, but also, as we shall see,
in modern scientific medicine.</p>

<p class='c012'>Treatment by fumigation is perhaps the most
widely prevalent of these.</p>

<p class='c012'>Probably the earliest motive for “smoking” a
patient was merely the replacing of an offensive
by a pleasant odour, as we find it frequently
employed in malodorous conditions. Here the
practice links up with ancient ideas on epidemic
diseases.</p>

<p class='c012'>Behind this rationale, however, there lies perhaps
the idea of association of death with the
fœtor of decomposition and the expectation that a
pleasant aromatic odour will naturally “obviate
the tendency to death.” This view of the matter
must have become strengthened among nations
like the ancient Egyptians, who had discovered that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>aromatic substances might be relied upon to
preserve the body after death. Even in recent
times and countries similar customs have prevailed.
Scott in “The Bride of Lammermoor”
tells us that rosemary, southernwood, rue and
other plants were in Scotland strewn on the body
after death, and were “burned by way of fumigation
in the chimney.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Be that as it may, we find fumigation employed
all over the world as a rite of purification, particularly
during the menstrual and puerperal
periods, women being at those times regarded as
unclean or taboo.</p>

<p class='c012'>Later, in the natural course of evolution,
fumigation comes under the category of anti-demoniac
remedies.</p>

<p class='c012'>When disease was ascribed to the operation of
demons in residence in the patient’s body, a belief
at one time world-wide in its distribution, the
treatment mostly relied upon to cure the disease,
and, granting the premises, a perfectly rational
therapeutic method, was by various devices to
render the patient’s body too uncomfortable for
the demon. And among many other modes of
securing this desirable end was the smoking of the
demon out by strong odours, fumes being generated
around the patient by burning horns, hair, and
certain odoriferous woods and plants. Among
the Chippeway Indians, we are told, a species of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>cypress was set on fire for this purpose, and the
efficacy of the remedy was heightened by the
needle-shaped leaves of the tree flying off and
sticking in the spirit.</p>

<p class='c012'>Sometimes a medical man may feel disposed to
smile when he sees the priest in church “censing”
the Bible in order to drive away the evil one before
he begins to read it. Yet fumigation has lingered
on long in medicine as well as in religion. During
the severe epidemics of cholera in Egypt not so
many years ago, hundreds of pounds weekly were
spent upon bonfires of sulphur in the streets of
Cairo, a method of disinfection more likely to
drive off demons than to destroy the comma
bacillus in the drinking-water!</p>

<p class='c012'>In mediæval, Jacobean, and Georgian medicine,
fumigation was a favourite remedy. Every one,
for example, is familiar with the old-fashioned
treatment of fainting by burning feathers under
the nose. And perfumes and aromatics in general
were widely used in the medicine of those days,
as the following extract from Salmon’s “Dispensatory”
(1696) shows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class='c012'>“<em>Balsamum Apoplecticum Horstii</em>, Apoplectick Balsam
of Horstius.</p>

<p class='c012'>“<em>Take of the Oils of Nutmegs</em> ℥i, <em>of white Amber rectified</em>
℥ʃ, <em>Roses (commonly called Adeps Rosarum) of Cinnamon</em> A.
℈i., <em>of Lavender</em>, <em>of Marjoram</em> A. grs. xv. <em>of Benjamin</em>, <em>of
Rue</em> A. ℈ʃ <em>of Cloves</em>, <em>of Citrons</em> A. grs. iv. <em>Mix all well
together, then add Ambergrise</em> ʒʃ, <em>Oriental Civet</em> ℈iv., <em>Choice
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>Musk</em> ʒi. <em>Mix all according to Art, to the just consistence
of a Balsam.</em></p>

<p class='c012'>“<em>Salmon.</em> The Oil of Nutmegs is that made by expression,
all the rest are Chymical. <em>Horstius</em> saith, that in the
whole Republick of Medicine, there is scarcely found an
Apoplectick Balsam more illustrious for Fame, more noble
for Virtue, more worthy for Honour, more ready for Help,
and more fragrant for smell, than this. It chears and
comforts all the spirits, natural, vital, and animal, by
anointing the extremities of the Nostrils and the Pulses.
It cures Convulsions, Palsies, Numbness, and other Diseases
proceeding of cold.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p class='c012'>The modern physician may think this Balsam
“apoplectick” in a sense never dreamt of by its
author; nevertheless he must also sigh for the
faith that believed all those wonders.</p>

<p class='c012'>Here is another from the same source for “the
strengthening of memory”:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class='c012'>“<em>Balsamum Maemonicus</em> (sic) <em>Sennerti</em>. Balsam for
the loss of Memory.</p>

<p class='c012'>“℞ <em>of the juices of Bawm</em>, <em>Basil</em>, <em>flowers of Sage</em>, <em>Lillies</em>,
<em>Primroses</em>, <em>Rosemary</em>, <em>Lavender</em>, <em>Borrage</em>, <em>Broom</em>, A. ℥ii.;
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Aqua Vitae</span></i>, <em>Water-lillies</em>, <em>Roses</em>, <em>Violets</em>, A. ℥i.; <em>Cubebs</em>,
<em>Cardamoms</em>, <em>Grains of Paradise</em>, <em>yellow Sanders</em>, <em>Corpo

<em>Storax liquid and Calamita</em>, <em>Opopanax</em>, <em>Bdellium</em>, <em>Galbanum</em>,
<em>Gum of Ivy</em>, <em>Labdanum</em>, A. ʒvi.; <em>Roots of Peony</em>, <em>long Birthwort</em>,
<em>Oils of Turpentine</em>, <em>Spike</em>, <em>Costus</em>, <em>Juniper</em>, <em>Bays</em>,
<em>Mastick</em>, <em>Baben</em>, <em>Lavender</em>, A. ʒv. <em>Pouder them that are to be
poudered, then mix and distil in an Alembick, with a gradual
fire; separate the Balsam from the Water.</em></p>

<p class='c012'>“<em>Salmon.</em> In this we have put flowers of Sage instead
of Mynica or Tamarisk: otherwise it is <em>verbatim</em>. It is a
truly noble Cephalick, and it is reported to cause a perpetual
memory, both Water and Balsom are excellent good against

<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>Head, the Nostrils and Ears therewith. Dose gut. iii. ad vi.
This is that Balsam which <em>Charles</em>, Duke of <em>Burgundy</em>
bought of an English Doctor for 10000 Florentines.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p class='c012'>It is to be noted, by the way, the odours do not
“strengthen the memory” as a whole; what they
do is to revive special memories.</p>

<p class='c011'>The use of perfumes like camphor to ward off
infection has long been in vogue. The pompous
doctors of Hogarth’s time—just 200 years ago—carried
walking-sticks the hollow handle of which
formed a receptacle for camphor, musk, or other
pungent substances, which they held to their noses
when visiting patients, to guard against the smells
that to them spelt infection. And the air of the
Old Bailey used to be, and indeed still is, sweetened
with herbs strewn on the Bench, lest the prisoner
about to be condemned to death by the rope
might return the compliment and sentence his
judge to death by gaol-fever. To this day, also,
herbs are strewn about the Guildhall on state and
ceremonial occasions, an interesting survival.</p>

<p class='c011'>Demoniac possession was also largely responsible
for the nauseous and disgusting remedies of
which early medicine, both among the folk and
among the more educated medical men, was very
fond.</p>

<p class='c012'>Paracelsus was a great believer in such concoctions,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>one of which, <em>zebethum occidentale</em>, was
his own invention. Fortunately I am not compelled
to divulge the constitution of this remarkable
remedy. All I need say is that it was by no
means the “cassia, sandal-buds, and stripes of
labdanum” of Browning’s “Paracelsus”!</p>

<p class='c012'>Those unspeakable medicaments were (and are
still) sometimes applied externally, sometimes
administered internally. One of the most absurd
variants of this class was the holding of divers foulsmelling
mixtures under the patient’s nose for the
cure of hysteria, the idea being that the stench
would repel the “mother” from the patient’s
throat, whither it had wandered through sheer
boredom and lack of interest elsewhere.</p>

<p class='c012'>Nevertheless, out of these most absurd and to us
meaningless methods of treatment modern medicine
has here and there selected remedies which
experiment and experience have proved to be of
value; valerian, for example, which is still largely
employed for hysterical conditions, and asafœtida
(popularly named  “devil’s dung”).</p>

<p class='c012'>As a matter of fact, many pungent, strong-smelling
substances are powerful cardiac and
muscular stimulants.</p>

<p class='c011'>Nor must we overlook the carminatives, the
pleasantly smelling dill, aniseed, rue and peppermint,
the very names of which bring to our minds
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>the sweetness of old country places and the efforts,
not always vain, to quiet screaming country babies!
Well are they named the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">carminatives</span></i>, acting as
they do “like a charm.”</p>

<p class='c011'>In the Æneid we are told how once upon a time
his divine mother was revealed to pious Æneas
by a heavenly odour. And although Lucian
intimates that the gods themselves enjoyed the
smell of incense, yet, according to Elliot Smith,
the real object of incense-burning was to impart
the body-odour of the god to his worshippers.
Something of the kind, whatever the primary
motive may have been, must have been needed,
one would imagine, to drown the unpleasant smells
from the abattoirs in the temples where the sacrificial
animals were slaughtered.</p>

<p class='c012'>The wrath of the Lord God of the Hebrews
after the Flood, it will be remembered, was
appeased when he smelled the sweet savour of the
burnt offerings of Noah on his emergence from
the Ark. The sacrifice was, of course, the meal of
the god, the flesh of bullocks, rams, doves, and
what not, being spiritualised by the flames and so
transformed into food a spirit could absorb. The
Greek gods, it is true, refreshed themselves with
such ethereal delicacies as nectar and ambrosia,
but they were by no means indifferent to the square
meal of roast beef so punctiliously provided for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>them by human purveyors. Homer is always
careful to mention that, as often as a feast was
toward, neither the gods nor the bards were
forgotten, the former being fed before and the
latter after the heroes themselves had been
satisfied.</p>

<p class='c012'>When, following the Persian division of the
unseen world of spirits into good and bad, the idea
of an evil-minded and consistently hostile god
became popular, his odour was naturally enough
the opposite of that of the kindly gods. And as in
time he came to assume some of the attributes of
the Roman <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">di inferni</span></i>, he, like the dragons of an
even greater antiquity, sported the sulphury odour
of his underground dwelling.</p>

<p class='c012'>The Northern nations of ancient Europe, Grimm
tells us, believed that hell was a place of burning
pitch, whence arose an intolerable stench.
Our English word “smell” is obviously
related to a German dialect word for hell—<em>smela</em>—which
in turn is itself akin to the Bohemian
<em>smola</em>, resin or pitch.</p>

<p class='c012'>The Christian “hell” was thus the lineal
descendant of the subterranean “Hades” of the
pagans, and what its stench was like may be
gathered from that of the noxious fumes that
rise out of clefts in volcanic rocks, such fumes,
we may suppose, as in earlier days threw the
Oracle at Delphi into her prophetic trances.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>(Some authorities, however, say that it was the
smoke of burning bay-leaves that the Oracle
inhaled.)</p>

<p class='c012'>The offensive odour of hell adheres to all the
devils right down to modern times. In the Middle
Ages you could always tell the Evil One by his
sulphurous stink, but, unfortunately for the
tempted, it was not usually observed until after
his departure.</p>

<p class='c012'>But evil odours not only attended the devil
himself: they were also generated by the sins.
For St. Joseph of Copertino, “seeing beneath the
envelope of the body,” was able to recognise the
sins of the flesh by their odour. And St. Paconi,
so it was said, could even smell out heretics in his
day, presumably in the same way as witches are
now discovered in Africa.</p>

<p class='c012'>Moreover, as the devil and his minions are
attended with a vile smell, the odour of their
infernal home, so naturally they detest what
we call sweet and aromatic perfumes and are
repelled by them, as the following tale from
Sinistrari of Ameno shows. I give it <em>verbatim</em>
as it appears in Sax Rohmer’s “Romance of
Sorcery”:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class='c012'>“In a certain monastery of holy nuns there lived as a
boarder a young maiden of noble birth who was tempted by
an Incubus, that appeared to her by day and by night, and
with the most earnest entreaties, the manners of a most
passionate lover, incessantly incited her to sin; but she,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>supported by the grace of God and the frequent use of the
Sacraments, stoutly resisted the temptation. But all her
devotions, fasts, and vows notwithstanding, despite the
exorcisms, the blessings, the injunctions showered by
exorcists on the Incubus that he should desist from molesting
her, in spite of the crowd of relics and other holy objects
collected in the maiden’s room, of the lighted candles kept
burning there all night, the Incubus none the less persisted
in appearing to her as usual in the shape of a very handsome
young man.</p>

<p class='c012'>“At last among other learned men whose advice had been
taken on the subject was a very erudite Theologian, who,
observing that the maiden was of a thoroughly phlegmatic
temperament, surmised that the Incubus was an aqueous
demon (there are in fact, as is testified by Guaccius, igneous,
aerial, phlegmatic, earthly, subterranean demons, who
avoid the light of day) and prescribed an uninterrupted
fumigation of the room.</p>

<p class='c012'>“A new vessel, made of glass like earth, was accordingly
brought in, and filled with sweet cane, cubeb seed, roots of
both aristolochies, great and small cardamom, ginger, long-pepper,
caryophylleae, cinnamon, cloves, mace, nutmegs,
calamite, storax, benzoin, aloes wood and roots, one ounce
of triapandalis, and three pounds of half brandy and water;
the vessel was then set on hot ashes in order to distil the
fumigating vapour, and the cell was kept closed.</p>

<p class='c012'>“As soon as the fumigation was done, the Incubus came,
but never dared enter the cell; only, if the maiden left it
for a walk in the garden or the cloister, he appeared to her,
though invisible to others, and, throwing his arms around
her neck, stole or rather snatched kisses from her, to her
intense disgust.</p>

<p class='c012'>“At last, after a new consultation, the Theologian prescribed
that she should carry about her person pills made of
the most exquisite perfumes, such as musk, amber, chive,
Peruvian balsam, etc. Thus provided, she went for a walk
in the garden, where the Incubus suddenly appeared to her
with a threatening face, and in a rage. He did not approach
her, however, but, after biting his finger as if meditating
revenge, disappeared, and was nevermore seen by her.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>On the other hand, the odour of sanctity in
mediæval times was a much more real perfume
than that in which the Jackdaw of Reims died. It
does not seem, so far as I can make out from my
reading, that the sweet smell of the Saints was ever
remarked in the early centuries of the Christian
era. The odour diffused around his pillar by St.
Simeon Stylites, for example, was by no means
pleasant. But by A.D. 1000 the sweetness of the
Saints’ persons was beginning to pervade the
religious atmosphere. Writing about that time,
Odericus Vitalis tells us that “from the sepulchre
of St. Andrew” (at Patras, Asia Minor) “manna
like flour and oil of an exquisite odour flow, which
indicate to the inhabitants of that country” what
the crops will be like that year. And the example
thus set by this apostle is followed by all other
saintly personages for many centuries.</p>

<p class='c012'>In England, we read that when the Blessed
Martyr Alban’s burial place on the hill above
Verulamium was opened, in obedience to a sign
from heaven in the shape of a flash of lightning,
the good people were enraptured by the delicious
fragrance of the Saint’s remains, and the same
characteristic attended those of the later martyr
Thomas à Becket.</p>

<p class='c012'>St. Thomas à Kempis is credited with the statement
that the chamber of the blessed Leduine was
so charmingly odorous that people who were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>privileged to enter it were delighted, and wishing
to enjoy her perfume to the full, were wont to
approach their faces close to the bosom of the
Saint, “who seemed to have become a casket in
which the Lord had deposited His most precious
perfumes.” After the death of St. Theresa a
salt-cellar which had been placed in her bed preserved
for a long time a most delicious odour.
And so on indefinitely, some of the stories being,
as might be expected, a little too plain-spoken and
artless for modern readers.</p>

<p class='c011'>It is difficult to account for the pleasant odour
of Saints whose pride it was to live without change
of raiment, to harbour parasites, and to abstain
from washing. Nevertheless that certain persons
exhale a naturally pleasant aroma from their bodies
is true. Alexander the Great is noted by Plutarch
as having so sweet an odour that his tunics were
soaked with aromatic perfume, and taking a flying
leap through the pages of history, we come to
Walt Whitman, who had the same characteristic.
Indeed, a piny aromatic odour, of considerable
strength, is occasionally noticeable in certain
people, and I can myself testify that it becomes
stronger on the approach of their death.</p>

<p class='c012'>We are not often told when historical heroes
were unpleasant in this respect, but in the case of
Louis XIV. we have the authoritative evidence of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>Madame Montespan, who after their “divorce,
when having a public set-to with her sun-god in
the glittering <em>salles</em> of Versailles, discomfited that
little, red-heeled, bewigged, and pompous mannikin
with the following broadside:</p>

<p class='c012'>“With all my imperfections, at least I do not
smell as badly as you do!”</p>

<p class='c012'>His ancestor, “Lewis the Eleventh,” says
Burton in “The Anatomy of Melancholy,” “had
a conceit everything did stink about him. All the
odoriferous perfumes they could get would not
ease him, but still he smelled a filthy stink.”</p>

<p class='c012'>A modern rhinologist would suspect this
monarch of having been afflicted with maxillary
antrum suppuration. It will be noted, however,
that there is no record that the odour he himself
perceived was perceptible to others. The fœtor,
as we say, was subjective, not objective, in which
respect it differed from that of another historical
personage, Benjamin Disraeli to wit, who was the
subject probably of the disease known as ozæna.
(See later.)</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>
  <h2 class='c010'>CHAPTER VI<br /> <span class='large'>THE ULTIMATE</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c011'>In a former chapter we dwelt upon the curious
fact that memories aroused by olfactory stimuli
are independent of the will. Now there is yet
another way in which smell ignores the head of the
cerebral hierarchy.</p>

<p class='c012'>Although on occasion confining its operations to
the subconsciousness, and exercising, so to speak,
only a backstairs influence upon the mind, olfaction
much more frequently insists upon recognition,
breaking in upon our privacy, like a disreputable
acquaintance, at most inopportune
moments.</p>

<p class='c012'>If you do not wish to see you can look the other
way. When you would rather not hear you can
be inattentive. A proffered handshake you can
ignore. A dish you dislike you may decline. But
you can’t help smelling—no, not even if you
turn up your nose.</p>

<p class='c012'>Olfaction is thus the great leveller among the
senses, equality having here a reality but rarely
found elsewhere. For odour makes its way into
the nose of king and cadger, duke and drayman,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>lady and lout, indifferently. Nay, by an
ironical law of olfaction the fœtors are more
powerful than the fragrances, and vervain the
feeble turns tail before the onslaught of scatol
(as well it might, indeed!), in which case there
is nothing to be done but to bear it (without the
grin mostly); or to follow the wise example of
vervain; or to remove the offence, as we have done
in England these latter days, only to render ourselves,
as I have carefully pointed out in Chapter I.,
all the more sensitive to it when it does come.</p>

<p class='c012'>To many of us it comes on the dog.</p>

<p class='c012'>This animal has a regrettable fondness for
wallowing, diligently and with forethought, in the
Abominable, until his coat is thoroughly well
impregnated. For no other reason, I do verily
believe, than, as he thinks, to give his human
friends for once some of the olfactory pleasure he
himself enjoys. A treat he thinks it, without any
doubt. Just look at the smirk of pride and satisfaction
on his face as he trots in and resumes his
place on the drawing-room hearthrug and the
amazement with which he receives the sudden toe
of your boot!</p>

<p class='c012'>And yet he rolls himself over on the odoriferous
for the same reason that a fashionable lady has
orris-root put in her bath; namely, for the
pleasure and gratification of society at large.
There are who say that my lady’s perfume seems
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>as vile to her Pekinese as his then does to her!
If so, he is the more tolerant animal of the two.</p>

<p class='c012'>Anyhow, he certainly has the knack of thrusting
the Unmentionable upon the attention of the
most fastidious, and smell is no longer speechless.</p>

<p class='c011'>Now, if we are to treat fully of things olfactory,
we must at least take cognisance of the Unmentionable.
But to extend our notice would
take us across the garden to the muckrake and the
dunghill. And such nearer investigation and
description I must decline, even although in these
days of outspokenness I may have to apologise for
Victorian squeamishness. To attain merit as a
writer the advice now given you is: Be frank!
And if you disgust, why, so much the better!</p>

<p class='c012'>That may be so. I do not question the value of
the advice, not for a moment. All I say is that
I prefer not to take it. And if somebody else
desires this particular laurel-crown, this crown of
tainted laurel, he shall wear it without arousing
any envy upon my part, albeit, as I know full well,
this is a branch of the subject which illuminates
many obscurities and seeming eccentricities in
human conduct. I know all about that, but, as
Herodotus so often says, I am not going to tell all
I know, although, I fear, an allusion or two may
be necessary.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>We may take it as on the whole true that a
repulsive odour is a dangerous odour. Not
invariably, however. Otherwise grouse in their
season would not be esteemed a dainty and
Gorgonzola would everywhere be buried. Nevertheless
in these high realms palatability is limited
to quite a narrow streak. There is a level beyond
which the boldest gastronomic adventurer dare
not climb.</p>

<p class='c012'>It is remarkable that the liking for half-decomposed
food, although an acquired taste, is found
everywhere in the world, among savage and
civilised, rich and poor, high and low—but not
among young and old. For young people do not
usually approve of such <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">recherché</span></i> flavours. It
would be a mistake, however, to argue from that
fact that these savoury meats act as fillips to a
sense jaded with age, because it is generally agreed
that neither smell nor taste declines in acuteness
as we grow old. On the contrary, they become
more instructed, more particular, more delicate.
Appetite declines if you like, but taste and smell
abide increasingly unto the end.</p>

<p class='c012'>Nevertheless we can only look upon this particular
liking as acquired, since the high relish of
one country but fills its neighbours with disgust.</p>

<p class='c012'>It is worthy of remark, perhaps, that the last
whiff, the final sublimated breath of ripe Gorgonzola
as it passes over, is a faint suggestion of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>ammonia. Curiously enough, this always fills my
imagination with the sack of cities and the end of
all things in smoke and thunder. It may be
because the penultimate phase of life itself is
ammonia. Fire, slaughter, and much more besides
come quite promptly to this gas for the City of
Destruction, what there is left of the remainder
in dust and ashes being but a handful for the wind.</p>

<p class='c011'>To the keen-sensed medical man certain morbid
states can be recognised by their exhalations.
I have even heard of an enthusiast on the subject
who alluded to them as “both visible and tangible”;
but that, I think, must be exceptional.</p>

<p class='c012'>Physicians of the last generation used to speak
of typhus fever as having a close, mawkish odour,
and the smell of smallpox is horrible. But these,
as well as the appalling stench of the hospitals in
olden days, are among the smells which have, for
the most part, fled our country.</p>

<p class='c012'>There are others, however, less powerful and
repugnant, which are still with us, and which we
recognise as among the prominent characteristics
of certain maladies, the acid smell of acute
rheumatism for one, and I have sometimes
thought I could detect a characteristic odour also
in acute nephritis, a smell resembling that of chaff.
The odour of a big hæmorrhage is unmistakable
and, to obstetricians particularly, ominous.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>Then there is the smell of mice which attends
upon the skin disease known as favus.</p>

<p class='c012'>The breath of a chronic drunkard is familiar
enough to everybody, and the more delicate aroma
in the circumambient atmosphere of the careful
tippler, ethereal and by no means unpleasant, will
often reveal to the physician the hidden cause of
obscure symptoms. It is particularly valuable
when your patient is, as so many of these secret
drinkers are, a woman, it may be a woman of good
social standing.</p>

<p class='c012'>A disease-odour of great value and significance
is the sweet-smelling breath caused by acetone
poisoning in the later stages of diabetes.</p>

<p class='c012'>A sweet smell is also said by Bacon to attend
plague:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class='c012'>“The plague is many times taken without a manifest
sense, as hath been said. And they report that, where it is
found, it hath the scent of a smell of a mellow apple; and
(as some say) of May-flowers; and it is also received that
smells of flowers that are mellow and luscious are ill for the
plague, as white lilies, cowslips and hyacynth.” (Quoted
by Creighton, “A History of British Epidemics,” p. 685,
f.n.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p class='c011'>Death sometimes heralds his approach by means
of an odour, said in some parts of the country to
bring ravens about the house, which may well be
true, as it is apparently a summons of the same
nature that calls the Indian vulture in flocks from
apparently untenanted skies. Birds in general,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>however, seem to belong to the microsmatic group
of animals, relying chiefly upon their vision,
which is often highly perfected, particularly for
distance.</p>

<p class='c011'>Much has been made, too much perhaps, of the
part played by olfaction in the sex-life, and its
undoubted prominence in the coupling of four-footed
animals is pointed to as an indication of its
potency in mankind also. But the reasoning is
fallacious. Olfactory influences predominate in
these animals simply because olfaction is their
principal sense.</p>

<p class='c012'>Among birds, now, courtship and marriage are
conducted without any apparent aid from olfaction,
and in no group of beings, not even in mankind,
is the poetic side of courtship, both before
and after marriage, so highly developed and so
beautifully displayed. In their love-making the
birds appeal to each other through the ear in their
songs, and through the eye in the nuptial splendours
of the male, splendours which he parades
with glorious pomp before what often seems to
be, indeed, but a lackadaisical and indifferent
spouse.</p>

<p class='c012'>As we have already seen, this independence of
olfactory stimuli is, so far as obvious indications
go, also the case with human lovers. True, we
have numerous references by poets to the sweetness
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>of their ladies’ breath, only one, as far as I
know, being blunt enough to say:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“And in some perfumes there is more delight</div>
      <div class='line'>Than in the breath that from my mistress reeks.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>But the sum and substance of Havelock Ellis’s
exhaustive inquiry on this point is undoubtedly
this, that if a lover loves the aroma of his lady, that
is because of his love, not because of her inherent
sweetness. In other words, the attraction, subtle
though it be, at least in the early or romantic stage,
is seldom or never obviously olfactory. It is the
suggestion of closer intimacy that constitutes the
attraction of her nearer environment, and this
suggestion is the offspring of the lover’s imagination.</p>

<p class='c012'>As to the influence of her personal emanation
in the second, the realistic, stage, there also, it
would seem, its power is subsidiary, certainly to
that of touch, although more active than that of
sight and hearing, seeing that the holy of holies is
only unveiled in darkness and in silence.</p>

<p class='c012'>As for our opinion in everyday life, I think most
people will subscribe to the old adage “<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Mulier
bene olet dum nihil olet</span></i>.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>
  <h2 class='c010'>CHAPTER VII<br /> <span class='large'>SMELL AND THE PERSONALITY</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Whatever of myth there may be in the quaint
stories we related in Chapter V., there is no doubt
about this, that there is great variety among
different individuals in respect to their personal
atmosphere. I mean the natural atmosphere of
the person, of course, not the artificial airs that
surround and envelop the beperfumed modern
lady.</p>

<p class='c012'>There is no need to enlarge upon this branch of
our subject. Those who are curious about it may
apply themselves to Havelock Ellis for more
detailed information. What I am concerned with
here is something much less commonplace and
obvious, the question, namely, whether we disseminate
and receive, each of us, anything less
material than the odours we are conscious of.</p>

<p class='c012'>In addition to his other olfactory accomplishments,
our friend the dog seems to be able to distinguish
by smell when a strange dog is to be
cultivated as a friend or wrangled with as a foe,
and nothing is more amusing to watch than the
careful and even suspicious olfactory investigation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>two dogs meeting for the first time make of each
other’s odours, during which exchange of credentials
a state of armed neutrality exists, to pass,
apparently as a result of some mysterious olfactory
decision, either into frank, open, and unchangeable
hostility, or into friendship equally frank,
open, and unchangeable.</p>

<p class='c012'>But what it is that makes one dog smell to
another of enmity or of friendship is as mysterious
as—the mutual attraction or repulsion felt for
each other by two human beings, shall we say?
For, of course, this suspense of judgment on
encountering a new-comer is a human no less
than a canine trait. There were physiognomists
before Lavater, since we are naturally influenced
by what our senses, and especially our eyes and our
ears, tell us about a person we are meeting for the
first time. We like the look of the man, his
expression, his smile, the character of his movements,
bodily as well as facial; we find the intonation
of his voice, his accent, his laugh, agreeable.
Or we don’t. And our decision is curiously
independent of his moral character, even after we
have got to know that side of him. Now, this act
of judgment seems to us to be quite independent
of any olfactory evidence. We rely upon our predominant
senses just as the dog relies upon his.
Yet I sometimes catch myself wondering whether
olfaction, olfaction rarefied and refined beyond
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>imagining, does not without our knowledge play
some part in our estimate of the pros and cons in
character.</p>

<p class='c012'>What is conveyed to us by the “personality”
of a man? Here we have apparently a complex
of sense-impressions, for the most part vague,
which we are seldom able to analyse, even to
ourselves. Still less can we put it into words
capable of conveying our impression to other
people. “There is <em>something</em> about him that I
like” is about the sum-total of our attempts at
description.</p>

<p class='c012'>And if this be true as between man and man, it
is even more often remarked as between man and
woman. Meredith it is, I think, who says that the
surest way to a woman’s heart is through her eye.
Fortunately for most of us, his dictum is open to
question. Otherwise the human race would soon
come to an end. Now, although, unlike Meredith,
I cannot claim the rank of a high-priest in the
temple of Venus, yet so far as I may dare to express
an opinion upon a matter so recondite, not to say
mysterious, I should rather be inclined to say that
the surest route is by way of her ear, and I am
fortified in my belief by an authority as erudite in
these matters as Meredith himself, Shakespeare to
wit:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“That man that hath a tongue, I say, is no man</div>
      <div class='line'>If with his tongue he cannot win a woman.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>John Wilkes, they say, to all appearance a “most
uninteresting-looking man,” asked for only half an
hour of a start to beat the handsomest gentleman
in England at the game of games. Women forgot
what he was like as soon as he began to talk.</p>

<p class='c012'>Who has not seen women turning sidelong
glances, with that surreptitious intentness we all
know so well, towards some very ordinary man in
whose voice they, but not we, detect the indefinable
something that has the power of luring these shy
creatures from their inaccessible retreats? What
man has not seen this play and puzzled over it?
The quality—is it perhaps something caressing,
or something brutal and ultra-masculine, or
both at once? Who knows what it is that their
intuition perceives?</p>

<p class='c012'>So we ask, we less favoured mortals, as we turn
and look at him also, hard and long, only to give
it up with a shrug!</p>

<p class='c011'>When I am one of a crowd under the spell of an
orator—a rare bird, by the way, in England—I feel
his power less in what he says than in how he says
it. Gladstone, for example, swayed his audience
by the fervour of his personality, not by any beauty
of word or thought in his rhetoric. How meaningless
his speeches seem to us nowadays as we vainly
try to read them, how involved, discursive,
ambiguous, turgid. How dull! And yet we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>know that these same involved, discursive, ambiguous,
turgid and dull speeches could and did
rouse hard-bitten Scotsmen to a wildness of
enthusiasm that seems to us incredible.</p>

<p class='c011'>Thus the personality is something that travels
on the wings of sound. But is that all? Is there
not something more, something imperceptible
which yet exercises a secret power over our
emotions and passions? Is there an olfactory aura?</p>

<blockquote>
<p class='c012'>“Why does the elevation of the Host in a Roman
Catholic church bring such an assurance of peace to the
congregation?” writes a friend of mine. “This remarkable
sensation I have myself frequently experienced and
wondered at. Yet I am, as you know, a Scots Presbyterian,
and do not credit for a single moment the miraculous change
of bread and wine. And yet to this gracious and comforting
influence I have been subject on more than one occasion.
It is for all the world as if the constant pin-pricks of our
normal life were suspended for a moment or two.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It is present only during service, and then only at the
culmination of the rite.</p>

<p class='c012'>“As I do not believe in the miracle, the influence must
come to me from without, not from within myself. Indeed,
I have actually come to the conclusion that it is borne in
upon me not by the church atmosphere with its incense,
nor by the solemn intonation of the priest, nor by the
whisper of the muted organ, nor yet by the distant murmur
of the choir, but—by the congregation itself!</p>

<p class='c012'>“It is from the kneeling worshippers that the mysterious
influence emanates, invisibly, inaudibly, intangibly, to
suffuse with the peace of some other world the spirit even
of an unbeliever....”</p>
</blockquote>

<p class='c012'>Is it possible that influences such as these may
enter by the olfactory door?</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>This perhaps may seem to be rather a fanciful
suggestion for a scientifically trained writer to
offer. But it is not wholly fanciful, since it has
some support at least from theory (whatever that
may be worth), and even from some considerations
based upon solid fact.</p>

<p class='c012'>As to theory, we have already seen how Fabre
arrived at the conclusion that the olfactory sense
of certain insects is capable of receiving stimuli to
which we are insensitive, stimuli which he surmised
to be of the nature of an ethereal vibration.
Consider too the following facts.</p>

<p class='c012'>It is well known that there are people who have
an instinctive dislike of cats. The late Lord
Roberts was one, and it is said of him that he was
aware of the presence of his <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bête noire</span></i> before he
caught sight of it. How was he made aware?</p>

<p class='c012'>The same instinctive aversion is felt by some
people towards spiders. I myself know of one, a
young girl, who cannot sleep if her bedroom contains
one of these creatures. She, like Lord
Roberts feels without knowing how when a spider
is near her.</p>

<p class='c012'>Here also is a letter to a newspaper from a
correspondent telling the same tale:</p>

<blockquote>
<div class='lg-container-l'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“<span class='sc'>Sir</span>,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>“I notice with interest that the official photographer who
is to accompany Sir Ernest Shackleton’s <em>Quest</em> expedition
has an intense dislike of spiders. Can any of your readers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>explain this uncanny horror, which I believe is shared by a
large number of people?</p>

<p class='c012'>“I myself loathe and fear spiders—so much so that I have
been known on more than one occasion to go into a darkened
room and to declare the presence of one of these creatures,
my pet abomination being subsequently discovered....</p>

<div class='lg-container-r'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“F. E.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

</blockquote>

<p class='c011'>What sense-organ—because there must be
one—enables F. E. and others like him (or
her) to detect the presence of a small creepy-crawly?</p>

<p class='c012'>We turn now to a series of medical cases which
may throw some light upon this peculiarity.</p>

<p class='c012'>There are people who suffer from asthma when
they go near horses. To enter a stable or to sit
behind a horse is to them a certain means of
bringing on an attack.</p>

<p class='c012'>This susceptibility and the peculiar form taken
by the reaction remind us of hay fever. In
sufferers from this troublesome complaint the
pollen of certain plants has an irritating effect upon
the mucous surfaces of the eyes, nose, and bronchial
tubes. So in like manner recent investigation
has shown that there is in the blood of the
horse a proteid substance which acts as an irritant
poison to those susceptible people. Their asthma,
therefore, is merely a manifestation of the irritation
produced by the poisonous body or its
emanation when it is borne to them through the
air. Similarly we are justified in arguing that cats
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>and spiders may throw off an effluvium which is
irritating to those susceptible to it.</p>

<p class='c012'>But it is to be noted that the antipathy in these
last instances manifests itself, not in a tissue change,
but in a feeling of the mind, an emotion. Nay
more, these people do not smell the cat or the
spider, except in the way that James I. “smelled”
gunpowder. Nevertheless, the irritant must travel
through the air as an odour does, and it probably
enters the organism by the mucous membrane of
the nose.</p>

<p class='c012'>But does it act upon the olfactory cells? Here
we encounter, I must confess, a serious obstacle
to an acceptance of this theory.</p>

<p class='c012'>The interior of the nose is sensitive not only to
odours, but also to certain chemical irritants.
Any one who has peeled a raw onion or has taken
a good sniff at a bottle of strong smelling-salts
knows what I mean. Now, the chemical irritant,
in the latter case ammonia gas, affects not the
olfactory nerve, but certain naked nerve fibrils in
the mucous membrane belonging to what is known
as the fifth cranial nerve, a nerve of simple
sensation.<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c017'><sup>[2]</sup></a> And the simultaneous irritation of the
eyelids, and in the case of the pollen and horse
effluvia the bronchial tubes, shows that these
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>resemble in their action the simple chemical
irritants, and not the odours.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f2'>
<p class='c012'><a href='#r2'>2</a>. The difference between those two sensations becomes clearly
evident when an anosmic person is peeling an onion. The usual
irritation of the eyes and nose is felt and manifested, but the patient
is unaware of any odour.</p>
</div>

<p class='c012'>It must be remembered, however, that, as we
have said, the cat and the spider effluvia induce an
emotional effect simply, without local irritation.
And emotional change not only follows, it may
also precede, the perception of an odour.</p>

<p class='c012'>The following anecdote of Goethe, for example,
shows how smell may affect the personality before
it is recognised as an odour by the consciousness:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class='c012'>“An air that was beneficial to Schiller acted on me like
poison,” Goethe said to Eckermann. “I called on him
one day, and as I did not find him at home, I seated myself
at his writing-table to note down various matters. I had
not been seated long before I felt a strange indisposition
steal over me, which gradually increased, until at last I
nearly fainted. At first I did not know to what cause I
should ascribe this wretched, and to me unusual, state, until
I discovered that a dreadful odour issued from a drawer
near me. When I opened it I found, to my astonishment,
that it was full of rotten apples. I immediately went to the
window, and inhaled the fresh air, by which I was instantly
restored. Meanwhile his wife came in, and told me that the
drawer was always filled with rotten apples, because the
scent was beneficial to Schiller, and he could not live
without it.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p class='c012'>I wish to emphasise, for the sake of my argument,
that Goethe underwent a profound constitutional
disturbance, with its attendant discomfort,
before he realised that its cause was an
odour.</p>

<p class='c012'>If, then, an odour can induce such emotional
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>changes without attracting attention to itself, the
suggestion is not, after all, so very far-fetched that
an emanation proceeding from the worshippers at
the moment of the elevation of the Host in a
Roman Catholic church may be transmitted to the
bystanders through the olfactory door to induce in
them an emotion similar to that felt by the
initiated.</p>

<p class='c012'>It may be objected that Goethe’s experience and
that of my friend are not alike, since Goethe
plainly, though tardily, became aware of a real
odour. It must be remembered, however, that
Goethe was a scientist and naturally gifted,
besides, with an unusual power of introspective
analysis. He found the cause of his disturbance
because he sought for it.</p>

<p class='c012'>Moreover, we learn from Havelock Ellis that
during religious excitement a real (and pleasant)
odour is sometimes perceptible in the atmosphere
around the faithful.</p>

<p class='c012'>May it not also be the same kind of influence,
transmitted in the same way, that dominates the
mind, in company with impressions received by
sight and hearing, when we are in the vicinity of
other people?</p>

<p class='c011'>Our study of smells has brought us, to be sure,
into a strange region of psychology, for it is
possible that we have here one explanation of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>mysteries of crowd-psychology, of those unreasonable
waves of passion that sometimes
sweep through masses of people and lead to all
manner of strange happenings, like crusades and
holy wars; <i><span lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">autos-da-fé</span></i>; witch-burnings; lynch-murders;
State-prohibition; spiritualistic manifestations;
and other miracles.</p>

<p class='c011'>(The somewhat uncanny “sense” we have
when some one else is present in what we suppose
to be an empty room may be olfactory in origin,
but it has generally seemed to me that it is due
rather to an alteration in the echo of the room, a
change in its normal sound-picture. If the room
is a strange one to us, I do not think we so readily
become suspicious of the presence of an unseen
and unexpected visitor.)</p>

  <h2 class='c010'>CHAPTER VIII<br /> <span class='large'>THEORIES OF OLFACTION</span><br /> (<i>The <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Pièce de Résistance</span></i>)</h2>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The anatomical structure of the olfactory end-organ
in the nose is, as we saw in Chapter II.,
simple.</p>

<p class='c012'>Contrast it with the eye. Here we have what is
obviously an optical instrument, with lens, iris
diaphragm, dark walls, and sensitive plate complete—a
photographic camera, in a word.</p>

<p class='c012'>Contrast it also with the ear, which is an
acoustic apparatus reminding us in its detail of a
recording gramophone leading to a closed box in
which are what look like a series of resonators, like
the wires of a piano.</p>

<p class='c012'>In the antechamber of each of those organs the
physical vibrations to which they respond undergo
considerable modification before they reach the
sensory cells.</p>

<p class='c012'>In the antechamber of the olfactory organ, on
the other hand, the amount of modification necessary
is evidently but slight, as the olfactory region
of the nasal chamber is merely a narrow, open
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>passage. As far as we know, all that takes place
is that the incoming stimulus, the odorous molecule,
is warmed and received by the nasal mucus.</p>

<p class='c012'>Thus the very complexity of the structure both
of the eye and of the ear helps us to comprehend
their function.</p>

<p class='c012'>But what can we deduce from a flat surface in
which all we can see is a collection of cells with
minute protoplasmic hairs projecting from their
distal ends? Obviously, little or nothing. We
are, in fact, confounded by simplicity. It may be
that we are here dealing with one of the essential
properties of all living matter, little, if at all, altered
from its primitive condition.</p>

<p class='c012'>To the physiologist, then, olfaction is the most
mysterious of all the senses. It still retains its
secrets, and therein lies the fascination of its
study.</p>

<p class='c012'>Of late years, the exploration of this dark
region of physiology has been, and is still being,
vigorously pushed, and we shall now proceed
to give what, however, can only be a brief
and superficial account of the progress made and
of the opinions held. Even so we shall be compelled
to make an incursion into the high and dry
realms of modern chemical and physical theory.
That may not be good hearing, but what is still
worse is that almost every single point we shall be
discussing is a matter of controversy.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>Let us commence with a few of the details,
mostly unimportant, upon which there is general
agreement.</p>

<p class='c012'>Consider, first of all, the variety, the almost
infinite variety, of odours. We have, for example,
all the odours of the world of Nature, the emanations
of inorganic matter, of the earth itself, its
soil and its minerals; to these we must add the
multitudinous perfumes of the vegetable kingdom,
of barks, roots, leaves, flowers and fruits, including
those of growing herbaceous plants, which differ so
widely from one another that it is said of Rousseau,
whose myopia was compensated for by an unusually
acute sense of smell, and who was, moreover,
no mean botanist, that he could have classified the
plants according to their smell had there been a
sufficiency of olfactory terms for the purpose;
then we have the thousand effluvia, some pleasant
and others not so pleasant, of living animals,
including the various races of mankind; next
come the—mostly repulsive—odours of decaying
vegetable and putrefying animal matter; and
finally the products of man’s own proud ingenuity
and skill, such as the artificial perfumes and
flavours on the one hand and on the other coal-gas,
acetylene, carbon disulphide, and the like.</p>

<p class='c011'>Parker notes it as worthy of remark that man
has created, both accidentally and intentionally,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>many new odours—smells, that is to say, which
have no fellow in the world of Nature—and he
emphasises the fact that the nose is nevertheless
capable of appreciating such novel sensations.</p>

<p class='c012'>In this connection we may mention that the art
of modern perfumery can imitate closely many of
the natural perfumes, and more particularly the
natural flavours, by mixing together essences, or
components, which in no way resemble the final
product.</p>

<p class='c012'>Thus the flavour of peaches can be compounded
artificially of aldehyde, acetate, formate, butyrate,
valerianate, œnanthylate, and sebate of ethyl, and
salicylate of methyl, with glycerine, glycerine being
added to the fruit essences, as it is to wines, in
order to restrain the evaporation of the volatile
bodies. (The fruit essences are used only in the
making of flavours. They cannot be employed
as perfumes, as they are too irritating to the
nose.)</p>

<p class='c012'>The union of components to form a product
different from any one of them is found also in
vision. When the colours of the spectrum, for
example, are commingled, the resultant white light
is devoid of any colour.</p>

<p class='c012'>Thus the potential responsiveness of the olfactory
organ seems to be practically inexhaustible.
So far, at all events, it has not yet reached the limits
of its capacity.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>The number and variety of recognised smells
being so great, then, one can readily understand
how difficult it is to construct a classification of
odours. Many attempts have, in fact, been made,
but, depending as they do more or less upon subjective
sensation, no two classifiers give us the
same classification. Indeed, a division of all
smells into “nice,” “neutral,” and “nasty”
would be about as good as many much more
ambitious efforts.</p>

<p class='c012'>Zwaardemaker’s is the classification most usually
followed at present, and as it is to him we owe
most of our knowledge of scientific olfaction, we
shall detail it here:</p>

<p class='c012'>(1) Ethereal or fruity odours; (2) aromatic,
including as sub-classes camphrous, herbaceous,
anisic and thymic, citronous, and the bitter almond
group; (3) balsamic, with sub-groups floral,
liliaceous, and vanillar; (4) ambrosial or muscous;
(5) garlicky (including garlic), oniony, fishy,
and the bromine type of odour; (6) empyreumatic
(guaiacol); (7) caprylic (valerianic acid);
(8) disgusting; and (9) nauseating.</p>

<p class='c012'>The subjective character of these classes is
obvious, especially in the last two groups, but,
apart from that objection, most people will be
inclined to protest when they learn that chloroform
and iodoform are put into the first, the ethereal or
fruity, group, while it is suggested, though to be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>sure with a query, that coffee, bread, and burnt
sugar may belong to the “repulsive” (pyridine)
group!</p>

<p class='c012'>The fact is that Zwaardemaker’s classification is
based upon a chemical foundation, that is to say,
upon properties which, as we shall see later on,
do not necessarily correspond with the odours as
we smell them. That, no doubt, explains his
inclusion of iodoform among the “fruity” odours.—Iodoform
fruity!—Shades of George Saintsbury
and his “Cellar Book”!</p>

<p class='c012'>A shorter classification is that of Heyninx, who,
aiming at objectivity, bases his arrangement, to
some extent at all events, upon the spectrum
analysis of odorous molecules in the atmospheric
medium, of which more anon. His list is: acrid,
rotten, fœtid, burning, spicy, vanillar or ethereal,
and garlicky. But here, also, the coupling of
vanillar with ethereal odours seems a little inappropriate.</p>

<p class='c012'>We stand, perhaps, on rather firmer ground
when we turn to the manufacturer’s classification,
founded as it is frankly upon subjective sensation,
and therefore devoid of any surprises to the logical
faculty. Here is Rimmel’s arrangement: rose,
jasmine, orange, tuberose, violet, balsam, spice,
clove, camphor, sandal-wood, lemon, lavender,
mint, anise, almond, musk, ambergris, fruit (pear).</p>

<p class='c012'>It may be objected, perhaps, that this is a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>catalogue merely, not a scientific classification.
That is quite true. But what is also true is that
the others we have quoted are little, if any, better.
The fact is that we do not yet possess the knowledge
necessary to enable us to arrange odours in
classes.</p>

<p class='c012'>The manufacturers, of course, concern themselves
with agreeable and attractive odours only.
To the great and growing company of the stinks
they pay no attention whatever. For that reason
their contribution to our knowledge is necessarily
but partial and limited.</p>

<p class='c012'>In their own proper domain, however, they can
point to several great successes. They recognise,
for practical purposes, about eighty primitive
scents. Many natural (to say nothing of many
unnatural) perfumes can now be prepared artificially,
and some so prepared are said to be even
more powerful than the natural productions.
Artificial musk, for example, is one thousand times
stronger than natural musk, Parker tells us.
Deite, on the other hand, says that the smell of
artificial musk is not equal to that of the natural!
Indeed, according to this authority, although
synthetic perfumes play an important part in the
concocting of scents, there are only a few of them
which can be used instead of the natural product.
What happens is that the artificial and the natural
are generally used in combination. Thus the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>“mignonette” of the shops is prepared by passing
geraniol, an artificial odorivector made from
citronella oil, over the natural mignonette flowers,
the resulting product being an essence smelling
strongly of mignonette, and not at all of geraniol.</p>

<p class='c012'>One or two, as we said, are purely artificial
imitations; coumarin, for example, the “new-mown
hay” of sentimental memory, which used
to be obtained from the tonka bean, is now entirely
made up by the synthetic chemist. But for all the
more subtle essences we have still to rely upon
Nature’s laboratory. The manufacturer steps in
and distils the precious essential oil certainly, but
it is from flowers that he obtains it. Attar of roses,
for instance, contains, in addition to natural
geraniol, a number of other ingredients which have
so far escaped analysis, a hundred thousand roses
supplying only an ounce of it. In like manner a
ton of orange blossom yields but thirty to forty
ounces of the odorous essential oil.</p>

<p class='c012'>Many of the costly plant perfumes come from
tropical or semi-tropical countries, such as Ceylon,
Mexico, and Peru. But tropical perfumes, though
strong, lack the delicacy of those found in temperate
climates. Cannes, on the Riviera, gives us
roses, acacias, jasmine and neroli; from Nimes
come thyme, rosemary, and lavender oil; from
Nizza, on the Italian Riviera, we get violets; from
Sicily, oranges and lemons; from Italy, iris and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>bergamot. English lavender, until quite recently
the most highly esteemed, came from the towns
of Hitchin and Mitcham. But I am informed that
the growing of lavender in England is no longer
pursued with the same success as formerly, and
we have to regret the disappearance of this old and
truly English industry.</p>

<p class='c012'>The natural musk, curiously enough, which
comes from the musk-deer of Tibet, is not used in
making musk perfume. It is, however, widely
employed in the perfumer’s art, as it has the
curious property of enhancing the strength of
other perfumes and of rendering them permanent.
Civet, also an animal product, being “the very
uncleanly flux” of the civet cat, has similar properties.
It is added to other perfumes to strengthen
them (“to set them off,” as it were) and to render
them more stable.</p>

<p class='c012'>But the most curious, and also one of the most
ancient of perfumes is ambergris, which is a
fatty, wax-like substance found floating in the sea
or washed ashore. It comes from places as far
apart as the west coast of Ireland, China, and
South America. The origin of this substance was
for long a mystery. But we know now that it
consists of the undigested remnants of cephalopods
(squids and octopuses) swallowed by the spermaceti
whale. Ambergris is used, like musk and
civet, to render other scents durable.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>But while the victory of the chemist is by no
means so complete as it is in the matter of the dyestuffs,
research is steadily going on, and the next
few years will almost certainly witness an evergrowing
conquest over this department of natural
chemistry.</p>

<p class='c012'>In the meantime chemists are applying themselves
to the creation of new varieties of perfume,
and, if we may judge from those disseminated by
certain ladies in public places, with a success that
startles and even irritates us. Compared with
them, the love-philtres of olden days must have
been but feeble things.</p>

<p class='c012'>“How d’you know you’re in the right ’bus?”
asked the ’bus conductor of the blind man who was
confidently boarding his vehicle.</p>

<p class='c012'>“This is the Maida Vale ’bus,” was the contemptuous
reply. “I knows it by the smell o’
musk.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The inexhaustible capacity of the olfactory
organ, to which we alluded above, is by no means
its only marvel. It is also of the most wonderful
delicacy, equalling, even if it does not surpass, in
this respect, the sensitiveness of the eye to light.</p>

<p class='c012'>This property of the smell-organ has been
scientifically estimated. There are many ways of
doing so, that by means of Zwaardemaker’s
olfactometer being perhaps the most popular:</p>

<div><span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span></div>
<blockquote>
<p class='c012'>“This consists of two tubes that slide one within the
other, and so shaped that one end of the inner tube may be
applied to the nostril. The odorous material is carried on
the inner surface of the outer tube. When the inner tube,
which is graduated, is slipped into the outer one so as to
cover completely its inner face, and air is drawn into the
nostril through the tube, the odorous surface, being covered,
gives out no particles, and no odour is perceived. By adjusting
the inner tube in relation to the outer one, whereby
more or less of the odorous surface is exposed, a point can
be found where minimum stimulation occurs. The amount
of odorous substance delivered under these circumstances
to the air current has been designated by Zwaardemaker as
an olfactie, the unit of olfactory stimulation. Having
determined for a given substance the area necessary for the
delivery of one olfactie, doubling that surface by an appropriate
movement of the inner tube will produce a stimulus
of two olfacties, and so forth. Thus a graded series of
measured olfactory stimuli can easily be obtained. Further,
by using outer tubes carrying different odorous substances
various comparisons can be instituted as measured in
olfacties” (Parker).</p>
</blockquote>

<p class='c012'>Instruments more elaborate and of greater
accuracy have, as a matter of fact, been devised
and used, but they need not detain us.</p>

<p class='c012'>The results obtained by these and other
methods of determining the minimum stimulus of
olfaction are certainly astonishing, and reveal as
nothing else can the delicate acuteness of the
sense.</p>

<p class='c012'>Fischer and Penzoldt found that they could
plainly smell one milligram of chlorphenol evaporated
in a room of 230 cubic metres capacity. This
is equivalent to 1/230,000,000 of a milligram to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>each cubic centimetre of air, or, assuming 50 cubic
centimetres of air as the minimum needed for olfaction,
the amount of chlorphenol capable of exciting
sensation is 1/4,600,000 of the thousandth part of
a gram—approximately 1/276,000,000 of a grain!</p>

<p class='c012'>Many other odours have been similarly tested,
and although there is much numerical discrepancy
in the records made by different observers, all
agree as to the extreme delicacy of the sense.
(For vanillin and mercaptan, see p. <a href='#Page_39'>39</a>.)</p>

<p class='c012'>Those experiments and estimations explain how
it comes about that many odours (musk, for
example) may go on giving off their scent until
they part with the whole of it <em>without undergoing
any appreciable loss of weight</em>.</p>

<p class='c012'>Thus there is no chemical test known to us so
delicate as olfaction.</p>

<p class='c012'>It has been found, for example, that over-assiduous
efforts at filtering and purifying the air
used for ventilation so as to remove all noxious
chemical and bacterial ingredients defeat their
own end. Such air, although to our artificial tests
absolutely clean and pure, seems to the sense of
smell to lack freshness. And the nose is right.
The tests are wrong. For sojourn in such an
atmosphere induces lassitude and torpor of mind,
as members of the Houses of Parliament, where
this method has been tried, know to their cost—and
ours.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>But albeit so highly sensitive to minute traces,
the sense occasionally fails to perceive a highly
concentrated odour.</p>

<p class='c012'>For example, every one is aware that a bunch of
violets which is filling a room with its fragrance
seems when held to the nose to have no smell at
all, or at the most to have but a vague, indefinable
sort of odour.</p>

<p class='c012'>The effect, as a matter of fact, varies with the
perfume employed. Some, like violets, have no
smell at all. Others give a different smell when
concentrated from what they give when dilute.
Muskone, for one, the essential constituent of
musk, has an odour of pines when concentrated;
and storax, a delightful perfume when dilute, is
disagreeable when too powerful, and so on.</p>

<p class='c012'>It is to be noted that the disagreeable character
of these last is not due to the mental “cloying” or
“sickening” of excessive sweetness; it is a
definite odour. Nor is the anosmia for concentrated
violets due to the exhaustion of the
sense.</p>

<p class='c012'>Heyninx, comparing, as we shall see, olfaction
with vision, believes the indefinite odour of
concentrated violets to be akin to the absence of
colour in white light. But this explanation seems
to me to be improbable, since the effect is due not
to the combination of a number of odours, as white
light is the combination of all the colours of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>spectrum, but to the overpowering influence of
a single odour.</p>

<p class='c012'>Indeed, none of the other senses shows the same
phenomenon. If we happen to catch a momentary
glimpse of the noonday sun, we plainly see a disc
of intense light (it is pale blue in colour to my eye),
surrounded by a fiery halo, before it blinds us.
In the same way, when a gun is fired close to the
ear, we hear the sound before we are deafened
by it.</p>

<p class='c012'>It is for such reasons that perfumers never sniff
at a bottle of scent; they take a little, rub it on the
back of the hand, and then wait until the spirit has
evaporated before they proceed to smell it.</p>

<p class='c011'>The exquisite delicacy of the sense might lead
us to suppose that the olfactory organ must be
quick at responding to its proper stimulus. But
such is not the case. It is, on the other hand,
relatively “slow in the uptake.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Gleg has estimated that the reaction time for
auditory sensation is from 0·12 to 0·15 of a second,
whereas the reaction time for smell is as much as
0·5 of a second, only one sensory stimulus being
slower, that of pain, namely, which occupies 0·9 of
a second.</p>

<p class='c011'>Odours are conveyed to the olfactory end-organ
in the air we breathe. Before they can rise into
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>the air from the odorivector (the odorous body) and
be transported they must, it is clear, pass into the
vaporous or gaseous state. (In the case of fish, of
course, the odour must undergo solution, that is
pass into the liquid state.) Many of the natural
properties manifested by smells have been related
to this transformation into vapour.</p>

<p class='c012'>Everybody knows how rich garden scents
become after a shower. It has been claimed that
this results from the lightening of the atmosphere
by the storm, in consequence of which the
diffusion of odorous vapours, following the law
that governs the diffusibility of gases, is facilitated.
But some of the effect must be due, one would
think, partly to the impact of the raindrops
breaking up and dispersing the halo of perfumed
air that surrounds each flower, and partly also
to the evaporation of the rain-water that has
absorbed these floral emanations.</p>

<p class='c012'>We are told also that during the night and in the
chill of early morning the air is less charged with
odours because cold checks the diffusion of gases.
This may be true enough for some odours, but I
am inclined to think that the fact is not stated with
perfect accuracy, as there are certain perfumes,
that of the tobacco-plant for one and that of the
night-scented stock for another, which are most
prevalent after nightfall. And it has always
seemed to me that Mother Earth is never so nicely
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>perfumed as on a cool September morning,
although I should never be inclined to call any
morning “incense-breathing,” like Gray, for anything
less like incense could scarcely be imagined.</p>

<p class='c012'>There is no doubt, however, that frost seals up
all odorivectors and renders the air quite odourless.</p>

<p class='c012'>A physical law appertaining to gases is also
invoked to explain the “clinging” of odours.
Many, if not all, solids and liquids when exposed
to air and other gases adsorb (cause to adhere) to
their surfaces a thin, dense layer or film of the gas.
If now that gas happens to contain an odour, or is
itself odorous, the odour must also be adsorbed,
and so in the case of porous materials, such as
fabrics, permeated by the odour, it lingers tenaciously
in their depths.</p>

<p class='c012'>Odorous bodies in the solid or powdered form
are known to retain their perfume for prolonged
periods. Look how long a sandal-wood box
remains aromatic. This property is supposed to
depend upon the lowered vapour tension of the
odorous molecules in the depths of the solid or
powder, in virtue of which they rise into the air,
or evaporate, but slowly.</p>

<p class='c012'>It would seem to be natural to suppose that, as
vaporisation plays such an important part in the
dissemination of odours, the volatile bodies and
liquids would be more odorous than the nonvolatile.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>But, as Zwaardemaker has pointed out,
this is by no means always the case. Many substances
of low volatility are nevertheless highly
odorous, and <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">vice versâ</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c011'>We turn now for a moment to consider the
behaviour of the odorous vapour in the nose.</p>

<p class='c012'>As it passes through the nose the current of
inspired air sweeps along the lower and middle
regions only; the upper or olfactory region is not
directly traversed. But almost certainly some of
the air is diverted up into the olfactory region in
light eddies, and the act of sniffing, which is a
short inspiration abruptly begun and ended, and
which we instinctively resort to when trying to
detect a faint odour, is obviously of a nature to
propel side-streams or eddies up into the olfactory
zone. One is reminded of the production of smoke
rings from a box.</p>

<p class='c012'>We smell not only during inspiration, however,
but also during expiration, the latter conveying to
the olfactory region the flavours of food and drink.</p>

<p class='c012'>Flavours, that is to say the olfactory elements of
so-called “taste,” are not appreciated to the full
until after deglutition. To most of us, although
experts and connoisseurs can determine it by
smelling the wine in the glass, the bouquet of port
has really no meaning until after it is drunk,
simply because the expiratory current of air as it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>ascends through the throat into the nose receives
the concentrated vapours of the warmed volatile
higher alcohols which are clinging about the
fauces.</p>

<p class='c012'>We may here remark that although we are
usually able to perceive that the odour and the
flavour of a sapid food or drink are akin to each
other, the sensation of the odour anticipating that
of the flavour, yet they are by no means always
identical. They may strike us as do a plain and a
coloured version of the same print. Sometimes
the flavour seems to be the more powerful, sometimes
the odour. Nearly all bouillons, for example,
possess a flavour more rich and full than the odour
they give off with their steam. On the other hand,
valerian has a strong, objectionable smell, which,
strange to say, becomes subdued and relatively
tolerable when that medicine is being swallowed.</p>

<p class='c011'>It is a curious fact, well known to expert
“tasters,” that if the eyes are kept closed during
the test, the delicacy of appreciation of flavours,
and also of the smell of the wine in the glass, is
entirely lost. I cannot suggest any explanation
for this curious phenomenon.</p>

<p class='c011'>Anosmia, absence of smell, which is the next
topic for our consideration, is a not uncommon
defect. It is generally the result of some form of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>nasal obstruction, such as a bad “cold in the
head,” as Æsop’s fox was clever enough to
remember. This type is temporary and remediable.
But there are other forms that are due to
nerve-disease, and for these nothing can be done.</p>

<p class='c012'>A congenital anosmia is occasionally met with,
and a curious partial anosmia, reminding us of
colour-blindness or tone-deafness. I myself know
people who cannot smell coal-gas unless it is very
strong, and I once knew a cook,—a cook who
couldn’t smell a bad egg!</p>

<p class='c012'>Albinos are said to be congenitally anosmic, and
there was recorded many years ago by Hutchison
the case of a negro who, gradually losing all his
pigment, became anosmic in consequence (cited
by Ogle). As the sustentacular cells of the olfactory
area contain granules of pigment (see
Chapter II.), we are forced to conclude that it must
exercise a highly important function in the perception
of odours. We shall see later on that its
presence is supposed by some to support the theory
that odour is a specific ethereal vibration similar to
light.</p>

<p class='c011'>We turn now to discuss the real nature of odour,
a section of our subject which is still theoretical
and highly problematical.</p>

<p class='c011'>Having accomplished so much in the art of perfumery,
the chemist ought, one would think, to be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>able to tell us whether or not there is any relationship
or correspondence between odour and chemical
constitution.</p>

<p class='c012'>When investigation of this point was begun, a
hopeful fact came to light, as it was pointed out
that certain bodies of similar chemical composition
had all the same kind of smell. These were the
compounds of arsenic, bismuth, and phosphorus,
all of which smell of garlic. But it was soon
realised that this fact was of little or no significance,
as the oxides of many of the metals, although quite
different from the former group, also smell of
garlic. To these we may add the instance of water
and sulphuretted hydrogen, two substances which
are related chemically, as their formulæ show
(H<sub>2</sub>O and H<sub>2</sub>S), and yet one of them is odourless,
While the other has a strong, unpleasant smell.
Finally, according to Deite, natural and artificial
musk have nothing in common but their smell.
Chemically they are quite different.</p>

<p class='c012'>The property of odour, then, does not depend
upon the Chemical constitution of bodies.</p>

<p class='c012'>The next question that arises is: Do bodies
exhaling the same kind of odour resemble each
other in the structure of their molecules? In
other words, can odour be related to molecular
structure?</p>

<p class='c012'>To the chemist all matter is made up of atoms
and molecules. The elements, bodies which cannot
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>be broken up by chemical action into any
simpler form, are composed of atoms. On the
other hand, when elements combine to form a
compound, the unit of the new body, composed
as it is of two or more atoms of different elements
linked together, is known as a molecule. (Probably
the elements also exist in the molecular
state, the atoms of which they are composed being
linked together in groups.) Both atoms and molecules
are, of course, very minute in size.</p>

<p class='c011'>For reasons we need not enter into here, the
molecule is held to have a certain structural form,
which form is indicated by what is known as a
graphic formula. The graphic formula of water,
one of the simplest, may be written as H—O—H,
and we may regard it as having a linear form.
(Modern views indicate that it is not a simple
line, but in two planes.)</p>

<p class='c012'>Many molecules, however, particularly those of
the organic compounds, are highly complex, and
their structural form must be very different from
that of water.</p>

<p class='c012'>The question, then, now before us is: Does
odour bear any relationship to the molecular
structure of bodies? And again it has been maintained
that a clue to the problem of the real
nature of odour lies here.</p>

<p class='c012'>There is a well-known series of chemical bodies
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>known as the “aromatics,” by reason of the fact
that they possess strong smells more or less similar
in quality. With regard to this series, which is made
up of groups of what are known as radicles which
occupy definite positions on a molecule shaped
like a ring—the benzene ring, as it is called—Henning,
a German observer, has expressed the
opinion that the odour depends, not upon the
radicles as such, but upon the position they
occupy on the ring.</p>

<p class='c012'>Transferring his argument to odorous bodies in
general, and taking six groups as embracing all
(spicy, flowery, fruity, resinous, burnt, and foul),
he associates each of these types with some feature
in the constitution of the molecule which is common
to all the members of each group.</p>

<p class='c012'>To enter more fully into this branch of the
subject would carry us too deeply into chemistry.
I shall content myself therefore with saying that
Henning’s views have received considerable support
from scientific chemists and have led to
several interesting and suggestive developments.</p>

<p class='c011'>Heyninx, however, criticising this theory, points
out that hydrocyanic (or prussic) acid and nitrobenzol,
two substances with the same smell, have
each a molecular structure in no way resembling
the other.</p>

<p class='c012'>The graphic formulæ of these bodies, which I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>give here, plainly show the difference between
them:</p>

<p class='c012'>H—C≡N (hydrocyanic acid) and</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/i_chemformula.jpg' alt='(nitrobenzol).' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c012'>(T. H. Fairbrother, to whom I am indebted for
much information on the chemistry of olfaction,
would dispose of this criticism of Hcyninx’s by
denying that the odours of those two substances
are identical. See later, p. <a href='#Page_132'>132</a>.)</p>

<p class='c011'>Chemistry, then, having, according to the
critics, failed us, we turn to the allied science of
physics. Physics deals with matter in its ultimate
state, beginning, so to speak, where chemistry,
with its work of changes and combinations, ceases,
and taking us deep into the heart of matter
independent of its chemical properties and
behaviour.</p>

<p class='c012'>We have seen that, chemically speaking, elements
and their compounds exist as molecules
made up of atoms. Now molecules may be
minute, and atoms even more minute, but in
“electrons,” the name given to the last divisible
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>particle of matter known to the physicist, we are
dealing with minuteness inconceivable. Sir Oliver
Lodge has said that if an atom could be expanded
to fill a space equal to that of the entire solar
system, the electrons composing it would each be
the size of an orange! There is supposed, indeed,
to be an atomic “system” composed of a central
nucleus like the sun, with electrons revolving
round it, the nucleus having a positive, and the
revolving particles a negative, electric charge.
Further (whether in virtue of these moving
electrons or otherwise is not quite clear), the molecule
is supposed to be in a state of constant
vibration.</p>

<p class='c012'>The physical theory of odour, then, refers that
quality to the vibration of the molecule. It
suggests that the molecules of an odorous body
passing in the gaseous or, in fishes, the liquid state
into the olfactory region of the nose, are there
received by the film of mucus in which the
olfactory hairs lie, and stimulate these hairs by
their molecular vibration. No chemical change
is supposed to take place, only, as it were,
a mechanical stimulation, comparable to the
mechanical stimulation of the retina by the waves
of light.</p>

<p class='c012'>A recent development of the theory which we
owe to Heyninx, a Belgian scientist, brings the
process very closely into harmony with what
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>occurs in the eye. According to this authority,
olfaction is in reality a perception of ethereal
undulations of the same character as the undulations
of light, these undulations being provoked
by the intra-molecular vibrations of the odorous
vapour in the nasal mucus and transmitted to the
olfactory hairs not by immediate contact, but
through the medium of the ether.</p>

<p class='c012'>We owe this last suggestion to the curious fact,
but recently discovered, that many odorous substances
(in their gaseous form in the air) absorb
the rays of ultra-violet light.</p>

<p class='c012'>In order to make clear what this means, we must
say a preliminary word regarding the spectrum and
spectrum analysis.</p>

<p class='c012'>The passage of a beam of white light through a
glass prism breaks it up into its component parts,
beginning with red, then orange, yellow, green,
blue, and ending with violet. Beyond the violet
end of the spectrum we know there are rays
invisible to us, but capable of acting on a photographic
plate. These are called the ultra-violet
rays.</p>

<p class='c012'>In like manner, beyond the red end of the
spectrum we know there are also rays, likewise
invisible to us, but perceptible by our tactile sense
as heat. These are called the infra-red rays.</p>

<p class='c012'>Now, the rate of vibration of all these different
rays, visible and invisible, has been estimated, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>they increase in frequency from the infra-red,
which are the slowest, to the ultra-violet, which
are the most rapid.</p>

<p class='c012'>As we have already said, it has recently been
shown that the odorous vapours absorb certain
ultra-violet rays. That is to say, when the beam of
light is directed through a chamber containing the
odorous vapour before entering the prism, what
are known as absorption-bands—vertical black
lines in the white—appear in the photograph of
the spectrum.</p>

<p class='c012'>Similar lines are seen, as a matter of fact, in the
visible spectrum of sunlight, and as these correspond
in position with the spectrum given by
chemical elements in an incandescent gaseous
state, it is supposed that they are produced by the
absorption of the corresponding light-rays by
these gases in the solar atmosphere.</p>

<p class='c012'>The physical explanation given of this phenomenon
is that the molecules of the gas in the sun
absorb such light-rays as are equal in rate of
vibration to the rate of their own vibrating molecule.</p>

<p class='c012'>In the same way, Heyninx and others argue that
the odorous vapour is composed of molecules
which are vibrating with a period equal to that of
the light-rays they absorb.</p>

<p class='c012'>Moreover, since the position of the absorption-band
in the photograph varies, lying in some cases
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>nearer to the visible violet and in others further
away from it, and since this position varies with
the particular fundamental odour employed, it is
suggested that not only do the molecules vibrate
with a period equal to that of the ultra-violet rays
they absorb, but as this vibration varies in rate, so
it is to this variation that we must ascribe the
differences in odours. This is analogous, of
course, to the appreciation of colour by the eye.
One odorous molecule, that is to say, like the
colour red, having a slower rate of vibration, will
give rise to one kind of smell; another, like the
colour yellow, with a more rapid rate, will give
rise to another kind of smell, and so on for all the
fundamental odours. Heyninx, indeed, goes so
far as to fix the position in the olfactory gamut of
all fundamental odours, and to base upon it the
classification we have already considered.</p>

<p class='c012'>It is supposed, that is to say, that the vibrations
of the odorous molecule set up undulations in the
ether, and that it is those ethereal undulations that
stimulate the olfactory hairs, just as ethereal
undulations emanating from a luminous source
stimulate the retina.</p>

<p class='c012'>There is one great difference, however, between
light and odour, a difference admitted, we may
mention, by the supporters of the undulatory
theory, but not emphasised by them. The difference
is this: in the case of visible light the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>ethereal undulations emanate from a source at a
distance (it may be like starlight at an enormous
distance) from the sensory end-organ, whereas in
the case of odour the undulation is supposed to
be generated by the odorous molecule in close
proximity to the end-organ.</p>

<p class='c012'>The theory makes no attempt to explain how
the olfactory hairs respond to these hypothetical
ethereal waves.</p>

<p class='c011'>Finally, we have the question of the olfactory
pigment to consider, and in this matter we cannot
do better than follow the exposition of William
Ogle, an English physician who wrote as long ago
as 1870. As will be seen, he forestalls the modern
undulatory theory of olfaction in a remarkable
manner.</p>

<p class='c012'>Ogle contends that the presence of pigment
must be of great importance in the function for
the following reasons:</p>

<p class='c012'>First, the epithelium of the olfactory region is
pigmented, while that of the rest of the nasal
chamber and sinuses is devoid of colouring matter.</p>

<p class='c012'>Secondly, there seems to be some correspondence
between the degree of pigmentation and the acuteness
of smell, as the following facts suggest:—</p>

<p class='c012'>In macrosmatic animals, such as the dog, cat,
fox, sheep, and rabbit, pigmentation extends over
a larger space and is darker in tint than in man.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>In these animals also the mucus covering the
olfactory area of the nose is itself pigmented.</p>

<p class='c012'>We have seen that human albinos are anosmic,
and the same is probably true of animal albinos.
But care is necessary in making observations on
suspected albinos in animals, as even when they
are altogether white a certain amount of black
pigment remains about the face and nose.</p>

<p class='c012'>The following reports, however, would lead us
to conclude that as with man, so with the animals,
a relative deficiency of pigment is associated with
a dull olfactory sense.</p>

<p class='c012'>It is by smell that the herbivora detect and
avoid plants which are poisonous, and when
poisoning does occur, it is usually a white animal
that suffers. In some parts of Virginia the farmers
will only rear black pigs, because, they say, the
white ones eat and are poisoned by the roots of
<em>Lachtanthus tinctoria</em>. For the same reason in the
Tarentino only black sheep are reared.</p>

<p class='c012'>Thirdly, the dark-skinned human races have a
keener sense of smell than the lighter races.</p>

<p class='c012'>Fourthly, the sense grows more acute as we get
older, as we have already seen, and nasal pigmentation,
it is said, also increases with age.</p>

<p class='c012'>As to the function of the olfactory pigment,
Ogle remarks first of all that odours are absorbed
more readily by dark than by light materials.</p>

<p class='c012'>Pigment is also present in the labyrinth of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>ear as well as in the eye, and its presence in these
organs seems to be essential to their activity.</p>

<p class='c012'>It is to be noted that the pigment does not occur
on the nerve structure in any of those end-organs,
but external, though contiguous to it. In the eye,
it lies in contact with the rods and cones of the
retina; in the nose, with the olfactory hairs; in
the ear, with the terminal bodies of the auditory
nerve.</p>

<p class='c012'>Hence the pigment, he supposes, must be
associated with the reception of the sensory
impressions.</p>

<p class='c012'>In the eye and the ear those impressions are
undulatory in character. That being so, he holds
that the undulatory theory of olfaction also is
probably the correct one.</p>

<p class='c012'>Ogle finishes with the remark that the theory
would be strengthened if it could be shown that
pigment was specially suited for the absorption
and modification of undulations.</p>

<p class='c012'>It is interesting to us to learn that claims are
now being made that pigment does possess the
power necessitated by Ogle’s theory. At all events,
there is a theory of vision (Castelli’s) which claims
for the ocular pigment the power of absorbing and
modifying light waves, and Heyninx holds that
the olfactory pigment possesses a similar property.</p>

<p class='c011'>Summing the whole matter up, then, we may
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>say that the undulatory theory of olfaction is, that
an odorivector gives off in the form of vapour (in
the aerial medium) extremely attenuated portions
of its substance, too minute to be weighed, and
that this vapour, disseminated through the air,
enters the nose in respiration, and, being wafted
up into the olfactory region, is received by the
mucus bathing the olfactory hairs, where, in virtue
of the ultra-violet radiations which proceed from
its molecules and are modified by the olfactory
pigment, it acts on the hairs, setting up changes
(it may be also undulatory in nature) in them and
in their cells, which changes are transmitted thence
by the olfactory nerves to the neurones or nerve-cells
of the olfactory bulb (or lobe) of the brain.</p>

<p class='c011'>The undulatory theory of olfaction, then, as will
be evident to the reader, has a good deal in its
favour. And in addition to what we have already
said of it as accounting for the absorption by
odorous vapours of ultra-violet rays, and as giving
a hint regarding the function of pigment in the
olfactory area, there are also a number of other
phenomena which it seems to explain. We have
seen, for example, how one odorivector, such as
musk or civet, may have the property of enhancing
the power of another, and this is a property which
is characteristic also of certain luminous conditions
(fluorescence, lumino-luminescence).</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>Again, there is a harmony existing between
certain of the manufacturers’ primitive odours;
“they go well together,” and are employed for
that reason in the art of perfumery. This resembles
the harmony existing in another class of undulations,
the sound waves.</p>

<p class='c012'>On the other hand, just as one sound may
silence another by the clashing of their waves, so
one odour may “kill” or neutralise another
odour (iodoform and coffee, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">e.g.</span></i>).</p>

<p class='c012'>There are several other minor phenomena which
are in agreement with this theory. They need not
detain us.</p>

<p class='c011'>We turn now to the criticism of the undulatory
theory of odour.</p>

<p class='c012'>First of all, we shall dispose of an objection
which, at first sight, has a very serious aspect.</p>

<p class='c012'>It may seem difficult to understand how vibrations
which appear to us when of a certain rate
to be light should when they are of another rate
become to us smell. How can one and the same
physical condition produce sensations so different?</p>

<p class='c012'>The same difference, however, is encountered
when we pass to the rays at the other end of the
spectrum, the reds and infra-reds. On one side of
the dividing line we only perceive these as heat;
on the other side they also become light.</p>

<p class='c012'>Obviously, the difference can only be due to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>different character of the sensory end-organ, the
receptor of these vibrations. As Head says:
“Each peripheral end-organ is a specific resonator
attuned to some particular kind of physical
vibration”—reminding us not only of soundresonators,
but also of wireless receivers, which
are “tuned” or accommodated to particular
wave-lengths.</p>

<p class='c012'>Thus, if red rays encounter certain tactile end-organs
in the skin, they are perceived by the mind
as heat, and if they pass into the eye and stimulate
the retina, they are perceived as red light. In
other words, in whatsoever manner an end-organ
is stimulated, it only induces its own particular
sensation.</p>

<p class='c012'>How it comes about that the various end-organs
induce such different sensations is not
yet known.</p>

<p class='c011'>The ultra-violet theory of olfaction, however,
has to run the gauntlet of much more serious
criticism than the difficulty we have just disposed
of.</p>

<p class='c012'>One great objection to it (to my mind) is that it
fails to account for another absorption phenomenon
of which I have not yet made any mention.
It was first observed by Tyndall nearly fifty years
ago.</p>

<p class='c012'>On submitting odorous vapours to examination
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>Tyndall found, not that they absorbed ultra-violet
rays, as this method is of quite recent usage, but
that they <em>absorbed heat-rays</em>, or the <em>infra-red rays</em>
of the spectrum. So that, if it be correct to say
that odours set up ultra-violet rays in the ether,
we must be equally ready to credit them with
setting up infra-red rays also!</p>

<p class='c012'>But there is another, and perhaps a stronger,
objection to the ultra-violet theory.</p>

<p class='c012'>In the interesting and highly instructive schema
drawn up by Heyninx of the wave-lengths of ultra-violet
absorbed by odours, we find one or two discrepancies
of a serious character.</p>

<p class='c012'>For example, iodoform and cinnamic aldehyde
show absorption-bands occupying nearly the same
position on the spectrum; and presumably, therefore,
these substances have the same molecular
vibration-rate. Yet their odours are not at all
alike!</p>

<p class='c012'>Again, acetone-methylnonic and butyric acids
have <em>precisely</em> the same absorption bands, and yet
they also exhale totally different odours.</p>

<p class='c012'>But the most serious discrepancy remains. The
absorption bands of hydrocyanic acid and watery
vapour (steam) have precisely the same position in
the spectrum, yet one of these has a highly
characteristic odour, and the other has none at
all!</p>

<p class='c012'>It is rather difficult, in view of these findings, to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>believe that this absorption phenomenon can have
anything to do with the quality of odour.</p>

<p class='c012'>My friend Mr. T. H. Fairbrother writes regarding
this controversy:—</p>

<blockquote>
<p class='c012'>“Whilst I do not for one moment suggest that the whole
phenomena of smell can be explained entirely in terms of
chemical constitution, I do maintain that it has much to do
with it, and I certainly think that more valuable information
about the cause of various odours has been obtained from
considerations of chemical constitution than from the many
extravagant physical theories which do not lead us very far.
In my view the physicists are begging the question, because
they usually postulate something which we cannot prove,
and whilst it is possible that the vibration of electrons
causes smell, how much wiser does that statement make us?
One might easily say that it was possible that the bombardment
of electrons caused smell, etc. On the chemical side,
however, we are bound down to experimental facts, and we
do know that esterification of carboxylic acids does bring
about a fruity odour invariably, etc. Chemical constitution
cannot explain fully all these phenomena, because chemical
formulæ themselves are only approximations, but the effect
of groups in a nucleus has done much to help synthetic
production of odorous bodies. When the physicist can
control the vibrations of his electrons and make them rotate
in accordance with his will, then he may be able to synthesise
new odours—till then we have no means of testing his
theories.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p class='c011'>The older view of olfaction—and many
modern scientists, as we see, still adhere to it—is
that the odorous molecule acts as a chemical
reagent upon the olfactory hairs. And there is
something to be said for this opinion.</p>

<p class='c012'>To begin with, no one doubts nowadays that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>odours are material. They pass through the air as
vapours, and they are known to travel miles on the
wind. That is to say, apart from those hypothetical
varieties of odour (if we can call them
odour at all) discussed by Fabre earlier in this
book, odours do not emanate from a point and
disperse in all directions as light and sound do.
Why then drag in the ether? Is it not more
probable that the odorous molecule acts on the
olfactory hairs by direct material contact, and that
it sets up chemical changes in them?</p>

<p class='c012'>We are asked to believe that the ultra-violet rays
of odour stimulate the olfactory hairs as visible
light-rays stimulate the retina. But it must not
be forgotten that in the eye those rays may induce
first of all chemical changes in the retina, just as
they would act on the silver salt of a photographic
plate, and that it may be by these changes that the
retina is stimulated.</p>

<p class='c012'>In the phenomenon of olfactory exhaustion, as
we said in our first chapter, we have a circumstance
which suggests the presence of some chemical
reagent in the olfactory area.</p>

<p class='c012'>It may be, of course, that in the nose as
well as in the eye the process is a combination
of chemical and physical changes. And in any
case we are here dealing with that obscure
region where chemistry and physics meet and
mingle.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>We have now come to the end of our discourse
upon the theories of odour, and it must be confessed
that we are still very much in the dark as to
the nature of the odorous, and as to the manner in
which it excites the olfactory organ to activity.</p>

<p class='c011'>Still more mysterious, however, is the process
by which the physical quality of odour becomes
the sensation of the mind we call smell.</p>

<p class='c012'>The transmutation of a physical quality into a
sensation is indeed the great mystery of all our
senses. Olfaction is not the only one before which
we throw up our hands, and this in spite of
the detailed and voluminous information which
modern physiology, neurology, and psychology
place at our disposal, perhaps less in spite of this
information than because of it, seeing that the
further our knowledge extends the wider seems
the unknown realm beyond. Our science is an
ever-expanding sphere, no doubt, but it is expanding
into the infinite.</p>

<p class='c012'>How is it that the rhythmic vibration of
matter becomes what we call “sound,” or the
rhythmic vibration of the ether “light”?</p>

<p class='c012'>How does the physical pass into and become
part of the psychic?</p>

<p class='c012'>According to recent teaching, the physical can
be followed as such from the sensory end-organ
itself as far as the first synapse, or junction with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>the neurone. But there something happens;&nbsp;...
then it reappears in a new guise, vibration becomes
sensation, the physical psychic, the objective
subjective, the real ideal, the dead alive!
In that brief tumble of time what a miraculous
transformation!</p>

<p class='c012'>Modern science has cleared up much of the
mystery of the objective world, and although it
may be far from the end of its search, although,
indeed, the search, one must think, can never
entirely elucidate the dense obscurity that envelops
us on every side, dark as a starless night around a
candle, yet we already know this much, that the
real world is very different from the world depicted
for us by our senses.</p>

<p class='c012'>Only a little imagination is needed to convey us
out of the magic circle into which we have been
born, and what a strange universe do we then
find ourselves in! Entangled in a meshwork of
space-time and permeated by whirling maelstroms
of varied and innumerable oscillations, we lose all
hold on reality in the very act of grasping it.</p>

<p class='c012'>But although we do possess some sort of vague
notion as to the constitution of the outer universe,
before the inner we stand ignorant and speechless.</p>

<p class='c012'>Regarded as a machine, the brain, it is true, like
the world without, is reluctantly yielding up its
secrets one by one. We are learning how it works
as a chemical factory, as a physical power-house,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>so that already we can surmise that here also we
have probably to deal with a multiplicity of
vibrations, of exquisitely minute transformations
of energy, of involved intercommunications, of
deft though intricate associations, of rapid yet
permanent recordings and registrations.</p>

<p class='c012'>We are now able to follow the undulations we
term light, not only into the eye, but into the brain
itself, locating their central station in the occipital
lobe, whence their effects radiate all over the
organism. And in the case of olfaction Pawlow
has taught us that its chief vegetative function, the
result of radiations from the olfactory central
station in the brain, is the arousing of the digestive
glands to activity. The first act of digestion is
olfaction. But the routes which the olfactory
stimuli follow in the central nervous system and
their communications with other sensory paths are
not yet known.</p>

<p class='c012'>The secrets of the brain which have been disclosed
to us, however wonderful they may be,
concern only, we must remember, the machinery
of the nervous system, that part, namely, which is
of the same nature and order as the objective
world, of which indeed it is a member. Hitherto
have we come, but no further:</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>The “thought” escapes us. Somewhere
beyond the boundary of the physical flits this
elusive, this tantalising ghost. How it is acted
upon and how it reacts we know to some extent.
But what the nature of its action may be is more
than we can determine.</p>

<p class='c012'>Nay! A moment ago we lightly spoke of
passing out of the magic circle into which we have
been born, and we forthwith proceeded to talk as
if we had in reality escaped from this our prison.
But there is no escape for us, of course. No man
can jump out of his skin. There undoubtedly are
such things as “waves,” or “undulations,” or
“oscillations,” or “vibrations,” or whatever we
like to call them. But they are not what we
imagine them to be. There is, we may suppose,
a four-dimensioned universe of “space-time.”
But it is beyond our conception. There is
“objective reality,” in a word. But it is no
reality to us. Those very expressions, glibly used
though they be, are but metaphors—“pretendings”
a child would call them—attempts to bring
the remote a little nearer to us, to clothe the
uncouth in the garments we ourselves wear; all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>of which is nothing but Maya—illusion—shadowplay.</p>

<p class='c012'>Let us not deceive ourselves. Along with the
recent revelations of physical science there comes,
say certain modern philosophers, the suspicion
that the universe is irrational. At every point we
are brought up short by the unknowable.</p>

<p class='c012'>For example, Einstein tells us that what we call
the “ether” has no existence. It is merely a
“void.”—But how can we call that void which
contains something—undulations, to wit?</p>

<p class='c012'>“Nay!” you argue; “the undulations traverse
the ether, but they are not it. The ether
is a non-entity. It has no existence. It is
nothing.”</p>

<p class='c012'>To which I reply: “But ‘nothing’ is an
absolute term. It means ‘no thing.’ How, then,
can undulations, or anything else for that matter,
pass through nothing?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“What nonsense!” you cry; “this kind of
verbal poser is just the silly old metaphysicians’
parlour game of playing with words.”</p>

<p class='c012'>I know it is. But the word-play has its uses.
It demonstrates to us that words, language, logic,
all alike, fail our thought, not so much because
those instruments are limited in power as because
the thought itself is lacking in precision and comprehensiveness.</p>

<p class='c012'>It is when our word-play probes the expression
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>that the vagueness of the idea is made manifest.
Our foil, even with the button on, goes clean
through the phantom.</p>

<p class='c012'>The mind, in short, has not absorbed, nor can
it absorb, the <em>fact</em>. We seize a glass of water to
drain it, and presently, like Alice, we find ourselves
swimming about in an ocean! Obviously the
universe <em>is</em> beyond our comprehension, a conclusion
desperate if you like, yet undeniable.</p>

<p class='c012'>But how very annoying it is, after all our heavy
labour, to hear the ancient scoff of Zophar the
Naamathite still ringing triumphant:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Canst thou by searching find out God?
Canst thou find out the Almighty unto perfection?”</p>

<p class='c012'>(Still we mean to go on trying!)</p>

<p class='c011'>Yet of all the senses none surely is so mysterious
as that of smell. For, as we have shown, the nature
of the emanations that stir it to activity is still
unknown; the simple structure of its end-organ
confronts us, like a sphinx, with silence; and after
the reception of the stimulus in the olfactory lobe
of the brain its further connections and communications
still remain unsurveyed, albeit, as I
have already so amply displayed, its effects upon
the <em>psyche</em> are both wide and deep, at once obvious
and subtle.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>
  <h2 class='c010'>CHAPTER IX<br /> <span class='large'>DUST OF THE ROSE PETAL</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c011'>By way of relief from the exacting mental strain
of the last chapter, I have thought that the reader
who has got this length might be grateful for something
more simple, and so it is not altogether
egotism that leads me to finish up with a few of the
olfactory pictures I cherish.</p>

<p class='c011'>Before proceeding with the subject-matter
proper of the chapter, however, let me put in a
plea for the conscious cultivation of the sense of
smell. But little more, I take it, is needed in this
way than to pay attention to the olfactory sensations
that reach us, for the very fact of taking note
of them is sufficient probably to increase the
power and delicacy of olfaction, this being always
the effect of the mental process known as attention.</p>

<p class='c012'>Smell may thus be easily cultivated and improved,
and with the increase in its appreciation
of the world comes an enriching of the other sense-impressions
that is quite surprising.</p>

<p class='c012'>It is possible that there is no substance in the
natural world entirely devoid of odour. At all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>events, after a time the amateur in smell may find
himself able, like Rousseau, to perceive perfumes
when other people do not notice any, and as a
mark at which he can aim let it be said that when
he finds himself able to distinguish streets from
each other by their smell alone he has made some
little progress in the art.</p>

<p class='c011'>The innate acuteness of the sense varies widely
in different people. Some go through life blunt to
all but the coarser smells, while others are gifted
with a sensitiveness as delicate almost as that of a
macrosmatic animal. This is scarcely an exaggeration.
I am acquainted with people—English
people—who are able to recognise by olfaction not
only different races and the two sexes, but even
different persons. One of those sensitives informs
me that to her the personal olfactory atmosphere
is every whit as characteristic and unmistakable
as the play of features or the carriage of the
figure.</p>

<p class='c012'>Another remarkable feat within the capacity of
human macrosmatics, and one that seems almost
incredible to the ordinary individual, is that of
being able to distinguish the clothing of different
persons by its aroma. Some can even recognise
their own, a remarkable circumstance in view of
the almost universal rule that each is anosmic to
his own particular atmosphere.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>It is true that we can get on quite well without
smelling. Probably congenital anosmia is the
least crippling of all sense-deprivations. But how
much it enters into our enjoyment of life when we
have once possessed it is shown by the blankness
that attends its loss; we feel then as if a tint had
been bleached out of the world.</p>

<p class='c011'>At this juncture we may stay a moment to allude
to the action of tobacco on olfaction. There are
few people nowadays who would uphold King
Jamie’s “Counterblaste,” wherein he denounces
smoking as—</p>

<blockquote>
<p class='c012'>“a custome loathsome to the Eye, hatefull to the Nose,
harmefull to the Braine, dangerous to the Lungs, and in
the black stinking fume thereof, neerest resembling the
horrible Stigian smoke of the pit that is bottomlesse.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p class='c016'>But, in fact, regarding the influence of the
tobacco-habit on the sense there is a conflict of
opinion. Some say it dulls olfaction; others, it
has no deleterious effect. My own experience
would lead me to agree with the former opinion.</p>

<p class='c011'>We now proceed with our memories.</p>

<p class='c012'>Who does not become a boy again when the
fragrance of a gardener’s bonfire fills the air? In
my own case when I smell it my eyes begin to
smart and to water, and I hear the laughter and
shouts of my brothers as, daring the wrath of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>Olympus, we leap over the blaze and land on the
white powdery ash that rises in clouds around us
to the ruination of boots and clothing. It is always
evening, “’twixt the gloamin’ and the mirk.” The
moon, still golden, is hung low in the sky; the wind
is sharp with a touch of frost, but the glare and the
glow of the embers reddens and warms us—at
least that part of us we turn to the fire. (Have you
ever felt the fierce pleasure of being at once
scorched and frozen?)</p>

<p class='c012'>In those few country places in Scotland where
the old Beltane fires of midsummer or midwinter
are still kindled, children are encouraged to pass
through the smoke, that being good for their
health. The custom, frankly pagan, is probably
the maimed rite of a sacrifice of children to the old
gods. That may be quite true, and yet I concur in
believing the practice to be beneficial. At all
events, the bonfires of so many years ago have left
with me a memory that has often recurred since,
and always with healing on its wings.</p>

<p class='c011'>Again, the fainter, keener odour of burning
pine-wood combined with the fanning sensation
on the face of the cold wind of the dawn always
brings back to me a summer morning at the Swiss
frontier station of Pontarlier after an evening
when vin ordinaire had induced effects extraordinaire
upon a youth unaccustomed to that fiery
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>beverage. Those, no doubt, were the days when
nothing mattered much. Nevertheless the fragrant
coolness of that morning after touches my aching
brow to this day with the soothing gentleness of a
hand fraught with understanding and forgiveness.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then what sea-lover is there but responds to the
salt pungency of seaweed on an empty beach?</p>

<p class='c012'>It is an interesting fact that the smell of the sea
may travel inland for miles on a favouring breeze.
With the south-west wind blowing moist, I have
in the heart of Lanarkshire repeatedly been stirred
out of everyday hebetude by the smell of the sea
on the Ayrshire coast, some thirty miles away.
And Réné Bazin (in “Les Oberlé”) says you can
even smell it sometimes in Alsace, 250 miles from
the Mediterranean.</p>

<p class='c012'>Once, indeed, at King’s Cross, London, I beheld
monstrous railway-stations and muddy streets,
with their motor-’buses, dingy wayfarers, yelling
newsboys and all, melting away into the glimmer
and space of the sea in a sort of magical transformation,
just as mist low-lying in Russell Square
will turn at times those garish hotels into sea-girt
palaces.... Only this time there was no mist.
There was, indeed, no need of mist. For the
spell of power was a sudden whiff of the sea
from far across the bricks, slates, and sooty
chimneys.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>But there is another sea-smell, equally powerful
and much less romantic. Can you endure the
breath of hot oil and metal from the engines of a
steamer without a qualm?</p>

<p class='c011'>If ever a boy has watched and helped the
fishermen clean and tan their nets, he will always
after, as often as chance brings the smell to his
nostrils, revive again the pit in the ground and the
gruff voices of the heavy-booted men pulling the
twisted net up and down, in and out.</p>

<p class='c011'>Or the bean-flowers’ boon?</p>

<p class='c012'>This, as it happens, concerns also somebody
else, but as she has long since been lost in the
crowd, I am not breaking any confidences in
recalling the scene.</p>

<p class='c012'>We are standing together beside the gate of a
hill plantation, and I see a tall lady’s delicately cut
profile against the sombre green and brown of the
fir-trees. Although the flush of the sunset has
almost entirely faded from the sky, it seems to be
lingering yet a while on her cheek as if reluctant to
leave her. As for me, I am as keen to every breath
of emotion as the little loch below is to the slightest
stir of air. The time is past for talk, and I am
watching her in silence. So I see the thin curved
nostril dilate a little, at once to be quietly restrained,
as if even this little display of feeling on her part
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>were out of place,—and then I also turn to look
at the butterfly bean-flowers in the field at our
feet.</p>

<p class='c012'>Now as often as the bean blooms, so does her
memory.</p>

<p class='c011'>How powerfully associations affect our olfactory
likes and dislikes we hinted on a former page,
and in this matter of smell-memories we can
observe the same effect. Smells which to others
seem offensive may, if they arouse a pleasant
memory, borrow from it a tinge that turns their
offence into a joy for ever. In my own case
iodine and the rather irritating odour of bleaching
powder are always welcome and always sweet.
Yet they recall nothing more interesting than the
days of childhood to me! On the other hand,
perfumes generally considered to be pleasant will
be objectionable to us if they arouse unhappy
memories.</p>

<p class='c011'>The most beautiful, however, are those which
have been young with us, and yet have never forsaken
us, by continual refreshment keeping an
eternal youth. And of all the odours in life none
surely is so rich both in retrospect and in prospect
as the smell of books to him who loves them. The
cosy invitation of a library! Not a public library,
needless to say, where the intimate appeal is lost
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>in a jumble of smells—dust, paste, ink and clammy
overcoats. Such public mixtures the bookworm,
that solitary self-centred individual, must, by
reason of his shyness, ever consistently shun.
But usher him into the private room of a private
house where books, many books, have reposed
for many years. Then go away and leave him
to it.</p>

<p class='c012'>The smell of a room full of books is slow to form.
Like the bouquet of wine, it must ripen. You have
to wait. But if you are able to wait, then one
fine day you will be welcomed there by the
snuggest smell in all the world, which, when
once it comes, will for ever remain, like rooks
in a clump of elms. I know a few houses where
this most seductive of all perfumes has resided for
untold years, and whence it will never depart as
long as our immemorial England endures. But
alas! like most people, I have only been a fleeting
visitor to those nooks of enchantment, and have
had to wait myself not once, but many times, as
often indeed as I have shifted my roof-tree, for
that ancient fusty atmosphere. There is, I fear,
no way of hastening the appearance of this
beckoning finger to oblivion. We need not linger
over the analysis of this particular odour. Book-lovers
know it. Others don’t care.</p>

<p class='c012'>“You are a reader, I see,” said an observant
doctor to me once.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>“How d’you know that?” I asked in surprise,
as we had just met for the first time.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I know it,” was his reply, “by the caressing
way you took up that book!”</p>

<p class='c012'>Your real bookworm loves all books. Like the
modern genius, he is amoral. But unlike the
genius, his amorality, simple soul, is confined
within the four walls of a library. He could never,
I am sure, bring himself to agree with André
Theuriet, who in “La Chanoinesse” depicts</p>

<blockquote>
<p class='c012'>“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">les <em>Bijoux indiscrets</em> auprès des œuvres de Duclos; <em>Candide</em>,
<em>Jacques la Fataliste</em> et <em>le Sophia</em> voisinant de <em>Restif de
la Brétonne</em> à deux pas de <em>l’Emile</em>, et <em>les Aventures du Chevalier
de Faublas</em>—une nouveauté—non loin de <em>l’Histoire
philosophique des Indes</em>,</span>”</p>
</blockquote>

<p class='c016'>all of which books, by a kind of moral exercise of
his imagination we cannot sufficiently deplore, he
found exhaling “une odeur de volupté perverse,
quelque chose comme le parfum aphrodisiac des
seringes et des tubereuses dans une chambre
close.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Every dwelling-house has its own peculiar
atmosphere, sometimes agreeable, sometimes not.
But, whatever its quality, so characteristic and
persistent are some of them that I am sure a blind
man would always be able to tell them by the smell
alone. Few of us may be gifted with the analytical
nose of a Charles Dickens to detect the ingredients
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>that make up a complex domiciliary atmosphere,
but everybody must have noticed that basement
houses smell differently from bungalows, the
former greeting you with a harmonious blend of
earthiness, soapsuds, and sinks.</p>

<p class='c012'>Nay! The house you live in has a separate
odour for each room: the drawing-room with its
chintzes; the snuggery with its stale tobacco, and,
perhaps, like an insinuating nudge, with a whiff of
the stronger alcohols; the bedrooms, if your
housekeeper knows her business, with the freshness
of well-aired linen.</p>

<p class='c012'>The very days of the week have each its own
particular olfactory mark, dating from our childhood:
Sundays (in Scotland), peppermint followed
by roast beef and richness; Mondays,
pickles and soapsuds; Tuesday, the damp airs
from the washing hung up to dry; Wednesdays,
warmth and beeswax from the laundry, with ever
and anon the thump of the flat iron; Thursdays,
bread new from the baker and the washing of
floors with soft soap—“Mind yer feet, now!”—Fridays,
jam-boiling and the never-to-be-forgotten
aroma of oat-cakes on the girdle; Saturdays—but
Saturday is a day of wind and banging doors,
of tops and dust; all its smells are out of doors.</p>

<p class='c011'>Shops, too! What of the coffee-shop?—Who
does not pause a moment at that door when the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>beans are roasting? One of the richest of all
odours that; curious how you lose it in the
beverage! Then there is the ironmonger’s, where
the sharp smell of steel strikes, by some strange
reflex, the upper incisor teeth and gums; the oil
and colour shop, with its putty, turpentine, and
general clamminess; and, last and best of all, the
druggist’s!</p>

<p class='c012'>What about the fried fish-shop? Faugh! I
once for a reason connected with my calling had
cause to spend a whole night in a room above a
fish-shop—once only. The next time (there
never will be a next time, she swears, but there
always is)—the next time I happened, curiously
enough, to arrive late!</p>

<p class='c012'>But although houses and rooms and, as we
hinted, streets also, all smell differently, each town
and city has its own peculiar fundamental odour.
There is a town in Yorkshire that smells of
“mungo.” I know another that smells of mineral
oil, and many that exhale the dank smell of the
coal-mine.</p>

<p class='c012'>London has a smell of its own, a fundamental
familiar odour, which, by the way, has changed of
late. Twenty years ago it was faintly acid with a
background of horses and harness. To-day it is
a mixture of tar and burned lubricating oil, by no
means so pleasant. In addition to these, however,
there is another and less prominent odour characteristic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>of the London atmosphere, which I confess
I cannot describe.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class='c012'>“Once upon a time, some forty years ago, there lived at
Highgate, which then still retained some of the characters
of a village, a lady who declared that when a yellow fog
drifted up from London she could detect the smell of
tobacco smoke in it. To most people the odour is flatly
that of coal smoke, which is perhaps always more or less
to be perceived in London air. This at any rate would seem
to have been the opinion of Edward Jenner, if we may trust
a note made by Farington in his diary for 1809, which is
being printed in the <cite>Morning Post</cite>. Farington’s note is as
follows:</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘Dr. Jenner observed to Lawrence that He could by
smelling at His Handkerchief on going out of London
ascertain when he came into an atmosphere untainted by
the London air. His method was to smell at His Handkerchief
occasionally, and while He continued within the
London atmosphere He could never be sensible of any taint
upon it; but, for instance, when He approached Blackheath
and took His Handkerchief out of His pocket where it had
not been exposed to the better air of that situation—His
sense of smelling having become more pure he could perceive
the taint. His calculation was that the air of London
affected that in the vicinity to the distance of three miles’”
(<cite>The Lancet</cite>).</p>
</blockquote>

<p class='c012'>Paris, in like manner, has its own peculiar
aroma. Lord Frederick Hamilton analyses it
correctly into “one-half wood-smoke, one-quarter
roasting coffee, and one-quarter drains.” But for
myself the Paris air always brings a curious half-suppressed
feeling of excitement, part of it
pleasure, part apprehension, as if something tremendous
were about to happen. But here perhaps
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>we cross the border-line between conscious sensation
and subconscious stimulation.</p>

<p class='c012'>Rome is a city of candles and incense mingled
with the dry mustiness of crumbling skeletons.</p>

<p class='c012'>In Edinburgh you encounter here and there the
smell of old Scotland. Thatch enters into its
make-up, why I cannot tell you. But the cold
grey metropolis still preserves the soul of the
thatch, a cosy sensation that is prone to bring tears
to the eyes of the returning exile.</p>

<p class='c012'>In Glasgow damp soot struggles with the smell
of the Bromielaw for the mastery.</p>

<p class='c012'>Dublin mingles the warm, rich aroma of
Guinness’s Brewery with the cold smell of a
corpse from the Liffey.</p>

<p class='c012'>Those are the cities I know best myself. But I
have often been told, and can quite believe it, that
every city has its own particular atmosphere.</p>

<p class='c011'>Some days, both in a city and in the country,
are as rich and full of odours as a Turner picture
is rich and various in colour. Other days bring
us but a grey Whistlerian monotone, in which,
nevertheless, the trained sense delights to distinguish
an infinity of tender shades, unobserved
by the casual.</p>

<p class='c011'>I used to think that country smells were particularly
dear to the country-born only, and that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>their charm lay in their evocation of childish
memories. But that is not the whole of the story.
They attract us by their own inherent beauty. I
have known town-bred lads linger about a stable
because the smell, I was told, was “so sweet.”
And most of us are, to be sure, sufficiently horsey
to enjoy that smell of straw and ammonia. We
linger near it as bees haunt clover or cats valerian.
And we are all horse-lovers sitting behind a smart
cob on a hot day when the smell of the harness is
mingling with the horse-odour. But these now
old-world odours are being every day more and
more ousted by the less pleasant smells of the
motor-car, petrol, lubricating oil, and acetylene—a
pure stink this last.</p>

<p class='c011'>But the farm is an olfactory museum, a library,
a symphony! How warm and comforting is the
smell of a byre full of cows! Plunge into it from
the cool of the evening and listen again to the
sudden swish of the warm milk into the pail, the
uncompleted low of the sober cattle and the rattle
of the chain as they turn to look at the new-comer.
A gentle relaxation of the spirit attends the visit
like the relief of the limbs from a cramped position,
and we readily fall into that mood, so rare these
latter days, when attention disperses and the reins
drop on the neck of the mind so that it wanders on
at its will up and down the lanes and by-ways of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>fancy. These paths are dangerous, to be sure,
leading as they do to the Castle of Indolence,
where you may dream your life away and be none
the wiser.</p>

<p class='c012'>Yet there must be many who have so wandered
regardless, and have wakened up too late to
recapture the days they have lost in dreaming, if
they ever do want to recapture them, which is
doubtful. If we really intended happiness in life—as
we do not; what we intend, and ensure, too,
for that matter, is excitement—but if we really
intended happiness, here is where we should find
it, in and about a farmyard as hangers-on. Not
as the farmer, needless to say, to whose mind these
olfactory stimuli are stimulant, not anodyne. So
that there can be no greater contrast than that
between him and us. Every one knows how the
idler idling irritates the worker working. And so
we are brought back to reality all too soon by the
slap of fate, waking up from a bank of thyme and
dreams to the pavement of worry and hard work.</p>

<p class='c012'>But it is sweet while it lasts, and if you can
acquire, or are lucky enough to have been born
with, pachydermia of the soul, then it may last for
a lifetime—unless, that is to say, fate, as aforesaid,
in the shape of the farmer, brings you back a-bump
to earth with a clout on the side of the head and an
order to take the hook and cut down thistles.</p>

<p class='c012'>Stevenson has told us that idling is no loss of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>time. Perhaps not, if we happen to be geniuses.
But the mischief is that the rest of your family
deny (with oaths) the major premiss, and the
prophet-without-honour consolation prize is
but a poor substitute for the loss of comfortable
eternities dozed away beside the lazy kine.</p>

<p class='c011'>Some time in the ’eighties of last century a
French professor (Jaccoud) recommended the air
of a byre as beneficial in phthisis.</p>

<p class='c012'>I have known worse cures.</p>

<p class='c011'>Why do not the perfume-makers present us
with more of these gateways to Paradise, short
cuts beside which De Quincey’s laudanum in the
waistcoat-pocket is but a by-path to hell? We
might be given odours of peace and contentment—think
of them in the hands of a clever wife!
We might make libraries of them as people make
libraries of gramophone records. So far all we
have are flower scents, like roses, lilies, violets, and
outlandish Eastern aromata, redolent rather of vice
and its excitements than of virtue and its placidity.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then there is the scent of thyme and roses in
the farm garden. This brings to me old Sundays
and ladies passing the open garden-gate on their
way to church, with their Bible carefully wrapped
up in a clean pocket-handkerchief, bearing with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>them also what somebody in Scotland calls “the
odour of sanctity”—peppermints, to wit—and all
the time the bees are humming in the warm air a
deep note to the trills and runs of the skylark
lost in the blue.</p>

<p class='c012'>But I could wander on for an eternity with these
smell memories and pictures. One more, and I
have done with the farm, and that is the cool smell
of the milk-house. It is dark there after the blaze
outside, and the stone flags strike cold to a boy’s
bare feet wandering in from the burning cobbles
of the courtyard. As your eyes become accustomed
to the dimness you can see on the floor the
wide, shallow milk coolers, silvery as full moons in
that twilight, the only light that enters coming
through the long slit of a narrow unglazed window
where blistery leaves of green docken, springing
rank from the unkempt garden without, show a
splash of sunlight. The smell is sourish and cold,
if we may speak, as I think we may, of the temperature
of a smell. This is forbidden land to boys
for obvious reasons, but so strong is the impression
that I have never forgotten my one and only visit
to that secluded chamber.</p>

<p class='c011'>What is it that gives to a dungeon its characteristic
smell? Emphatic as a blow. Obviously,
we have here a combination of several sense
impressions, tactile, visual, olfactory: tactile, for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>the air is damp and chilly; visual, for it is a blank, a
negative, and yet a powerful influence; olfactory,
smelling ominous and of death. Old dried bones
emit precisely the same exhalation. In a subtle
way, too, the presence of mould is perceptible, all
blending into the horrible and grisly atmosphere
of despair; the Valse Triste and the Dance of
Death.</p>

<p class='c012'>Smell can bring as certainly and as irresistibly
as music emotions of all sorts to the mind.</p>

<p class='c012'>In this same category we may place the dusty
smell of a dry hay-loft, which is curiously like that
of bitter almonds and hydrocyanic acid. It has a
sensation like ghostly fingers fumbling about your
neck with a threat, half playful, half serious, of
suffocation. And, curiously enough, the mental
feeling of throttling fingers is not amiss. Prussic
acid kills by paralysing the respiratory centres.</p>

<p class='c011'>Let us get out into fresh air again! The sun is
shining. A gentle breeze from the west is snowing
the lawn with fragrant hawthorn blossoms. I
catch a whiff of delicate lilac, and see coming
towards me over the grass a slender figure in
white....</p>

<p class='c012'>And so we close with the perfumes of the spring,
sunshine, and beauty.</p>
